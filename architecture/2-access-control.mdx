Sage implements a sophisticated witness-based access control system that ensures secure, type-safe interactions across all protocol modules while maintaining composability and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive operations.

### Configurable Witness Pattern

The witness pattern serves as Sage's foundational security mechanism, requiring specific witness types to prove authorization for protected operations. Unlike traditional access control that relies solely on address-based permissions, Sage's witness system provides run-time security guarantees through Sui's type system via configuration.

Each witness type is paired with a corresponding configuration object that defines which specific witness implementations are authorized for operations. This architecture enables flexible, upgradeable access control without requiring contract modifications. For example:

```rust
public fun verify_channel_witness<ChannelWitnessType: drop> (
    channel_witness_config: &ChannelWitnessConfig,
    _: &ChannelWitnessType
): bool {
    let type_name = type_name::get<ChannelWitnessType>();

    type_name == channel_witness_config.type_name
}
```

Sage's access control operates at multiple architectural levels, providing comprehensive security coverage:

- **Package-level Witnesses**: Control which modules can interact with core protocol functions (UserWitness, ChannelWitness, GroupWitness)
- **Administrative Capabilities**: Restrict protocol governance and configuration changes through AdminCap, FeeCap, RewardCap, and InviteCap structures
- **Object-level Permissions**: Combine witness validation with object ownership checks to ensure users can only modify their own data
- **Cross-package Validation**: Enable secure interactions between different protocol modules while maintaining isolation

### Practical Security Guarantees

The witness pattern provides several critical security advantages over traditional access control mechanisms:

- **Run-time Safety**: Type mismatches are caught during runtime, allowing for configurable package level contract control while avoiding circular dependencies in code
- **Composable Security**: Sage's security model could be further extended by creating custom witness types that integrate seamlessly with existing validation logic
- **Upgrade Flexibility**: Administrative functions can update witness configurations without requiring contract redeployment or user migration
