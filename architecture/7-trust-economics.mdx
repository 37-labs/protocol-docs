The economy of Sage Protocol revolves around the specialized \$TRUST token, designed explicitly as an Earned Mint Token (EMT). Unlike traditional tokens, the minting and supply of \$TRUST tokens are strictly driven by validated, onchain user contributions, aligning token economics directly with authentic social value creation.

### **Earned Mint Token (EMT) Model**

The \$TRUST token follows the EMT model, ensuring tokens are minted exclusively through actions validated by Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) system. This guarantees that each token issued represents a verified, meaningful social activity within the network.

### **Minting Phases & Pricing Mechanics**

Minting occurs explicitly in two distinct phases, governed clearly by the protocol’s `MintConfig`:

- **Phase 1 (Bootstrap Phase):**\
  Initially, minting takes place at a fixed, stable price (e.g., \$0.000001 per \$TRUST). This explicitly defined pricing strategy helps bootstrap early liquidity and encourages initial user participation, continuing until specific liquidity conditions are reached.
- **Phase 2 (Market-Driven Pricing):**\
  Upon achieving sufficient liquidity, the protocol transitions to dynamic, market-based mint pricing. In this phase, reward minting amounts adjust explicitly in response to real-time market valuations of \$TRUST tokens, ensuring token inflation aligns sustainably with ecosystem growth and market conditions.

### **Supply Control & Treasury Management**

Token supply is securely controlled through structured, onchain mechanisms:

- **Protected Treasury:**\
  The `ProtectedTreasury` explicitly manages treasury caps, securely controlling minting operations. Minting logic includes clear, explicit checks against maximum allowed supply, ensuring total issuance aligns precisely with configured parameters.
- **Reward and Governance Witnesses:**\
  All minting and administrative adjustments explicitly require authorization through secure witness-based mechanisms (`RewardWitnessConfig`, `GovernanceWitnessConfig`). These configurations perform runtime validation on minting or supply changes, explicitly preventing unauthorized token issuance or manipulation.

### **Economic Sustainability & Incentive Alignment**

The explicit economic architecture ensures sustainability and clear incentive alignment:

- **Cost-Anchored Rewards:**\
  Rewards explicitly correspond to verified onchain economic activity, particularly the transaction fees users pay. This ensures rewards directly mirror actual user-generated economic value, promoting meaningful contributions.
- **Incremental Incentives:**\
  Sage implements incremental rewards tied explicitly to sustained user engagement (such as commenting, sharing, and liking). This model clearly incentivizes ongoing, authentic community participation.
- **Controlled Inflation & Adaptive Economics:**\
  Through the explicit action-weighting model (`RewardWeights` and `RewardWeightsRegistry`), Sage administrators can dynamically manage reward values and minting parameters. This adaptive approach maintains economic balance and responsiveness to evolving network conditions.

### **Architectural Advantages**

Sage’s explicit economic architecture delivers significant benefits:

- **Transparency & Accountability:**\
  All minting activities, reward claims, and treasury actions are transparently recorded onchain, ensuring clear accountability and verifiability.
- **Adaptive & Sustainable Economics:**\
  Explicitly defined minting phases and dynamic reward adjustments enable the economy to sustainably adapt to market and community dynamics without disruption.
- **Robust Security & Controlled Minting:**\
  Witness-based minting authorization ensures token minting occurs securely, explicitly validating authorized operations and safeguarding the integrity of the token supply and ecosystem trust.

Through these clearly structured economic mechanisms, Sage Protocol establishes a sustainable, transparent economic environment explicitly designed to incentivize genuine social contributions and ongoing user engagement.
