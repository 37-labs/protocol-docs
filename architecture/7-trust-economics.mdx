title: "$TRUST Mechanics"
description: " "
---

The Sage Protocol economy revolves around **\$TRUST**, a specialized token designed as crypto's first **Earned Mint Token (EMT)**. Unlike traditional tokens with arbitrary or speculative issuance, the minting and supply of \$TRUST are exclusively driven by verified onchain user contributions—directly aligning economic incentives with meaningful social activity and network growth.

### **Earned Mint Token (EMT) Model**

\$TRUST tokens strictly follow the [EMT model](/introduction/3-emt), ensuring minting occurs exclusively through user actions validated by Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) mechanism. This guarantees each issued token represents a meaningful, measurable social contribution within the Sage ecosystem.

### **\$TRUST Minting Phases & Pricing Mechanics**

Token minting unfolds across two clearly defined phases, each governed by the protocol’s `MintConfig`:

- **Phase 1: Fixed Mint Pricing (Bootstrap Phase)**\
  Initially, tokens are minted at a fixed, stable price (e.g., \$0.000001 per \$TRUST). This strategy bootstraps early liquidity and incentivizes initial user participation, continuing until predefined liquidity conditions are met.
- **Phase 2: Market-Driven Mint Pricing**\
  After reaching sufficient liquidity and stable market valuation, Sage transitions to dynamic, market-based mint pricing. Token rewards then adjust transparently in response to real-time market valuations of \$TRUST, sustainably aligning token issuance with community growth and economic conditions.

### **Supply Control & Treasury Management**

Token supply is securely managed through clearly structured, onchain mechanisms:

- **Protected Treasury**: The `ProtectedTreasury` structure manages the treasury cap, securely regulating minting operations. Clear runtime checks enforce maximum allowed supply constraints, ensuring token issuance aligns precisely with configured economic parameters.
- **Reward and Governance Witnesses**: Minting and administrative adjustments require authorization via secure witness-based validation (`RewardWitnessConfig`, `GovernanceWitnessConfig`). This runtime validation prevents unauthorized minting or token supply manipulation.

### **Economic Sustainability & Incentive Alignment**

Sage’s economic architecture ensures long-term sustainability and aligned incentives:

- **Cost-Anchored Rewards**: Rewards correlate with verifiable onchain economic activity, directly reflecting transaction fees paid by users. This alignment ensures token rewards mirror actual user-generated economic value, incentivizing genuine network contributions.
- **Incremental Incentives**: Sage employs incremental reward structures that encourage sustained user engagement—such as commenting, sharing, and liking—clearly incentivizing continuous, meaningful participation across the community.
- **Controlled Inflation and Adaptive Economics**: Using the action-weighting model (`RewardWeights` and `RewardWeightsRegistry`), administrators dynamically manage reward parameters and token minting rates. This adaptive approach maintains economic balance and responsiveness to evolving ecosystem dynamics.

### **Architectural Advantages**

Sage’s economic framework provides substantial practical benefits:

- **Transparency and Accountability**: All minting events, reward claims, and treasury activities are transparently recorded and auditable onchain, ensuring clear accountability and verifiability.
- **Adaptive and Sustainable Economics**: Clearly defined minting phases and dynamic reward adjustments ensure the token economy adapts to market and community conditions without disruption.
- **Robust Security and Controlled Minting**: Witness-based validation ensures secure, authorized token minting operations, safeguarding token supply integrity and ecosystem trust.

Through these defined economic mechanisms, Sage Protocol establishes a sustainable and transparent economic environment uniquely designed to reward genuine social contributions and encourage ongoing, authentic user engagement.
