Sage’s core architecture is built around modular, easy-to-use smart contract packages, each designed for specific tasks but seamlessly integrated to power the entire protocol. This modularity makes it simple for developers to mix, match, and upgrade components—enabling quick customization, easier integration, and accelerated innovation.

## Core Protocol Packages

- **Admin Package: **Oversees administrative capabilities, including configurable protocol parameters, maintaining the protocol’s flexibility and responsiveness.
- **Analytics Package: **Tracks user and content engagement metrics, providing valuable insights to inform interactions and reward mechanisms.
- **Channel Package: **Facilitates the creation, management, and moderation of social channels, enabling structured and meaningful interactions within communities.
- **Post Package: **Enables decentralized content posting, commenting, and content engagement tracking, providing a comprehensive content-management framework.
- **Rewards (PoSC) Package: **Implements the Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) validation mechanism, systematically determining the eligibility and distribution of rewards tied explicitly to validated social actions.
- **Shared Package: **Defines the structs and functionality for data types that are used in the other packages (e.g. managing friends, follows, likes, and posts, etc.).
- **Trust Package: **Defines the \$TRUST coin and methods for minting and burning according to the logic defined in the Rewards package.
- **User Package: **Manages decentralized user identities, profile creation, authentication, user-specific actions, and relationships.
- **Utils Package: **Contains simple operations to act on basic types that are used consistently (e.g. string concatenation).
