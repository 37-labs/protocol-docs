Sage Protocol manages user-generated content and community interactions transparently and securely through decentralized, blockchain-native structures. The architecture incorporates explicit mechanisms for handling content, community moderation, transaction fees, and incentive alignment directly onchain.

### **Content Management**

Content within Sage Protocol is explicitly managed through verifiable blockchain structures:

- **Posts:**\
  Managed by the `Post` structure, clearly storing metadata (title, description), content data, author details, timestamps, interaction metrics (likes, comments), and edit/delete status.
- **Engagement Interactions:**\
  Explicit interactions such as likes and comments are tracked within dedicated onchain substructures (`Likes` and within `Posts`). These actions increment clear engagement metrics that form the basis for incremental rewards and analytics tracking.
- **Fee Management:**\
  The `PostFees` structure explicitly defines transaction fees required for creating or interacting with posts. These fees are configurable in native \$SUI tokens or custom denominations, clearly aligning economic incentives with user interactions.

### **Channels & Community Management**

Channels in Sage Protocol provide decentralized community-building environments managed through clear onchain structures:

- **Channels:**\
  Defined explicitly by the `Channel` structure, each channel transparently maintains metadata (avatar, banner, description), moderators, membership information, and interaction history. All channel activities, including moderation actions and membership updates, are clearly recorded onchain.
- **Membership & Moderation:**\
  Membership is explicitly managed by the `Membership` structure, which records precise join and leave timestamps along with membership statistics. Moderation roles and permissions are clearly maintained within the `Moderation` structure, providing secure and transparent moderation capabilities directly within blockchain data.
- **Channel Fees:**\
  Transaction fees associated with channel activities—such as creating channels, joining/leaving channels, posting, and moderation actions—are explicitly managed through the `ChannelFees` structure. These fees help sustain economically aligned community operations.

### **Cross-Application Interoperability**

Interoperability is explicitly enabled through structured indexing mechanisms:

- **App and Channel Registries:**\
  Structures like `AppChannelRegistry` and `ChannelRegistry` explicitly map channels to specific applications, facilitating seamless community portability across Sage-compatible apps.
- **Content Indexing:**\
  The `PostsKey` structure explicitly links groups of posts to specific applications, allowing consistent indexing and cross-application content reuse.

### **Security via Witness Validation**

Sensitive channel operations are secured explicitly through witness-based runtime validation:

- **ChannelWitness:**\
  Channel-related administrative actions (e.g., moderation updates) explicitly require validation via the `ChannelWitness` capability, preventing unauthorized modifications and ensuring secure and verifiable operations.

### **Architectural Advantages**

Sage’s explicit decentralized design offers practical advantages:

- **Transparent Content & Engagement:**\
  All content, interactions, and community activities are transparently auditable, fostering accountability and trust.
- **Portable & Resilient Communities:**\
  Decentralized channels resist censorship and allow communities to easily move between applications, supporting open and resilient social interactions.
- **Economically Aligned Participation:**\
  Explicit fee structures and integrated rewards ensure direct economic alignment with content creation and community participation, promoting sustainable ecosystem growth.
- **Secure & Modular Governance:**\
  Clear moderation roles and explicit witness-based validation provide secure, transparent, and adaptable management of community dynamics.
