Sage Protocol manages decentralized identities entirely onchain through a sophisticated dual-object architecture. This design effectively balances user privacy, ownership, and social functionality, giving users complete sovereignty over their digital identities and seamless interoperability across applications.

### **Dual-Object Identity Architecture**

<Card title="UserOwned Object (Private Data)">
  The `UserOwned` object securely stores private identity data and analytics, under the exclusive control of each user:

  - **Ownership:** Directly controlled by the user's own wallet.
  - **Data Contents:** Profile details (avatar, banner, description), private analytics (engagement metrics, earnings tracking), and personalized favorites (user-saved bookmarks for posts, channels, and other users).
  - **Access Control:** Only modifiable by the user’s wallet.
  - **Key Functions:** Private profile management, tracking personal analytics, managing favorites, and earnings monitoring.
  - **Storage Pattern:** Employs dynamic fields to handle application-specific data, such as analytics segmented by epochs and favorites indexed per app.
</Card>

<Card title="UserShared Object (Public Interactions)">
  The `UserShared` object handles public-facing interactions and relationships, making social data transparently available across the ecosystem:

  - **Ownership:** Publicly shared object accessible by all Sage-compatible applications.
  - **Data Contents:** Social connections (follows, memberships), publicly visible user-generated posts, and interaction analytics.
  - **Access Control:** Protected by explicit protocol rules and clearly defined actions, ensuring secure access and preventing unauthorized usage.
  - **Key Functions:** Facilitates public social activities—posting content, establishing connections, and interaction analytics.
  - **Storage Pattern:** Uses dynamic fields explicitly to store and manage app-specific data, such as analytics by epoch and content indexed per application.
</Card>

### **UserRegistry – Unified Identity Mapping**

The `UserOwned` and `UserShared` objects integrate via the UserRegistry, a decentralized mapping that connects usernames, wallet addresses, and identity objects. This integration ensures user identities remain consistent, verifiable, and fully interoperable across the Sage ecosystem.

### **Decentralized Social Graph Storage**

Social interactions and relationships are transparently recorded onchain using clear, dedicated structures:

- **Membership:** Records user participation in channels and communities, capturing explicit join timestamps and interaction histories.
- **Follows:** Manages user-to-user and user-to-channel relationships, providing transparent and verifiable social connections across apps.
- **Favorites:** Lets users bookmark their preferred content (posts, channels, users), maintaining portable and clearly defined preferences.

### **Key Advantages of Sage’s Architecture**

- **Interoperability:**\
  User identities, relationships, and reputational data seamlessly integrate across all Sage-compatible applications.
- **Ownership & Privacy:**\
  Users retain complete control over their personal identity data without reliance on centralized authorities, increasing autonomy and safeguarding user privacy.
- **Censorship Resistance:**\
  Decentralized onchain storage ensures identity and relationship data are resilient against censorship and arbitrary restrictions, protecting ecosystem integrity.

### Practical Benefits

- **For Developers:**\
  Easy integration of decentralized identity management (UserOwned, UserShared) and social graph structures (Membership, Follows, Favorites) without extensive protocol-level modifications.
- **For End-users:**\
  Effortlessly maintain consistent identities, relationships, and reputations across multiple apps, enhancing autonomy and minimizing friction.
- **Ecosystem-Wide Integration:**\
  Supports cohesive, seamless identity interactions and social connections across diverse decentralized applications, fostering a unified user experience.
