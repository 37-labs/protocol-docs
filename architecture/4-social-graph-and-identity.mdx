Sage Protocol manages decentralized identities entirely on-chain through a sophisticated dual-object architecture, effectively balancing user privacy, ownership, and social functionality. This architecture empowers users with complete sovereignty over their identities and interactions, enabling seamless interoperability across applications.

## **Dual-Object Identity Architecture**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="UserOwned Object (Private Data)">
    The `UserOwned` object securely stores private data and analytics, ensuring exclusive user control and ownership.

    - **Ownership:** Directly controlled by the user's wallet.
    - **Data Contents:** Profile metadata (avatar, banner, description), personal analytics (user engagement, earnings tracking), and favorites (user-defined bookmarks of posts, channels, and users).
    - **Access Control:** Only the wallet owner can modify this data.
    - **Key Functions:** Private profile management, engagement analytics, favorites, and earnings management.
    - **Storage Pattern:** Utilizes dynamic fields to manage app-specific data, including analytics segmented per epoch and favorites indexed per application.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="UserShared Object (Public Interactions)">
    The `UserShared` object manages public-facing interactions and relationships, supporting transparent, portable social data accessible to all applications.

    - **Ownership:** This is a shared object accessible and shareable across applications.
    - **Data Contents:** Social relationships (follows and memberships), user-generated posts, and public interaction metrics and analytics.
    - **Access Control:** Protected through explicit protocol logic and clearly defined actions, ensuring security against unauthorized access.
    - **Key Functions:** Facilitates social activities, including posting content, following other users or channels, and interaction analytics.
    - **Storage Pattern:** Utilizes dynamic fields explicitly to manage app-specific data, including: analytics segmented by epoch and posts indexed per application.

### **UserRegistry – Unified Identity Mapping**

Both `UserOwned` and `UserShared` objects integrate through the UserRegistry, a decentralized mapping structure linking usernames, wallet addresses, and user identity objects. This integration ensures identities remain consistent, verifiable, and interoperable throughout the Sage ecosystem.

### **Decentralized Social Graph Storage**

Social relationships and interactions within Sage are transparently stored on-chain using dedicated structures:

- **Membership: **Tracks user participation within channels and communities, recording explicit join timestamps and interaction history.
- **Follows:** Manages user-to-user and user-to-channel relationships, enabling transparent and verifiable social connectivity across applications.
- **Favorites: **Allows users to bookmark preferred content (posts, channels, users), maintaining clear and portable user preferences across the ecosystem.

### **Key Advantages of Sage’s Architecture**

- **Interoperability: **Relationships and reputational data across Sage-compatible applications.
- **Ownership & Privacy: **Users maintain complete ownership and control over their private identity data without relying on central authorities, enhancing autonomy and safeguarding privacy.
- **Censorship Resistance: **Decentralized on-chain storage ensures identities and relationships remain resilient against censorship or arbitrary restrictions, upholding ecosystem integrity.

### Practical Benefits

- **For Developers: **Easily integrate decentralized identity and relationship management (`UserOwned`, `UserShared`, `Membership`, `Follows`, `Favorites`) without extensive protocol adjustments.
- **For End-users: **Effortlessly maintain consistent identities, relationships, and reputation across multiple applications, enhancing user autonomy and minimizing friction.
- **Ecosystem-Wide Integration: **Promotes a cohesive application environment, supporting seamless interactions of identities and social connections across diverse decentralized experiences.
