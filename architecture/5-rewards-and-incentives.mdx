Sage Protocol implements a transparent incentive architecture designed specifically to reward authentic social contributions and meaningful user engagement. At the heart of this incentive model is the Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) mechanism, closely integrated with Sage’s native Earned Mint Token (EMT), the \$TRUST token.

### **Reward Calculation & Distribution**

Rewards in Sage are calculated explicitly based on validated user actions and clearly defined metrics:

- **Action-Based Rewards**:

  Rewards are precisely computed using defined numerical weights (_RewardWeights_) for each type of user action—such as creating posts, engaging with content, or joining channels. These weights reflect each action’s relative baseline contribution to the Sage ecosystem.
- **RewardWeights and Registry**: 

  Reward weights are stored and managed through the _RewardWeights_ structure, clearly specifying effective start and end epochs. The _RewardWeightsRegistry_ transparently tracks historical reward configurations, providing clear auditability of reward distribution.
- **Transaction Fee Alignment**: 

  Rewards are explicitly aligned with the economic value users create through transaction fees. Reward calculations directly leverage transaction fee data, ensuring incentives accurately reflect genuine onchain activity.

### **Earned Mint Token (EMT) – \$TRUST**

The \$TRUST token operates under Sage’s Earned Mint Token (EMT) model:

- **Minting Logic:**\
  \$TRUST tokens are minted exclusively from verified user actions. Users explicitly claim and mint tokens according to rewards precisely calculated by Sage’s reward logic, secured by the explicit validation through a _RewardWitness_ check.
- **Controlled Supply:**\
  \$TRUST minting is carefully regulated by the protocol’s _MintConfig_, which explicitly defines parameters like minting enablement and maximum supply. This ensures a controlled, sustainable token supply aligned directly with authentic user engagement.

### **Incremental Rewards**

Sage employs an incremental reward system to encourage sustained user participation:

- Initial user contributions (like creating content) explicitly receive immediate, clearly defined rewards.
- Subsequent interactions (such as likes, comments, shares) generate additional incremental rewards, transparently tracked through Sage’s analytics. These incremental rewards explicitly recognize sustained user participation, continuously benefiting both the original content creator and actively engaging users.

### **Reward Witness Authorization**

Security and transparency are reinforced through explicit RewardWitness validation. The _RewardWitnessConfig_ clearly defines authorized witness types required to securely verify reward claims at runtime, ensuring only authenticated rewards result in token minting.

### **Architectural Advantages**

Sage’s explicit reward architecture offers several practical benefits:

- **Transparency and Auditability:**\
  Clearly defined reward weights and historical analytics are transparently recorded, providing comprehensive auditability of reward issuance. All historical reward data across epochs remains explicitly accessible for clear verification.
- **Sustainable Economic Design:**\
  Explicitly linking reward calculations to actual transaction fees and employing controlled minting configurations ensures long-term economic sustainability. The token economy scales naturally with genuine user activity.
- **Flexible and Upgradeable:**\
  Administrators can dynamically adjust reward configurations (_RewardWeights_, _MintConfig_) securely at runtime without redeploying smart contracts, allowing Sage to flexibly adapt to changing ecosystem needs.
- **Genuine Engagement Incentives:**\
  The incremental reward model explicitly incentivizes ongoing, high-quality interactions, continuously rewarding sustained community engagement and fostering meaningful participation across the Sage ecosystem.
