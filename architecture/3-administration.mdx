Sage Protocol implements a secure and transparent administrative architecture to effectively manage critical operations within the protocol. It utilizes explicit administrative capabilities, structured witness configurations, and runtime checks to ensure security, controlled flexibility, and modular governance.

Although currently administered through clearly defined roles and permissions, Sage’s design explicitly embraces incremental decentralization. Distinct administrative capabilities have been strategically established, allowing the Sage team to gradually transfer control of specific protocol functions to community governance as decentralized mechanisms mature.

### **Administrative Capabilities**

Sage governance relies on clearly defined administrative capabilities, each focused on a specific domain:

- `AdminCap`: Manages core administrative privileges, including protocol-wide settings and updates.
- `FeeCap`: Controls transaction fee configurations, securely managing and updating fee parameters.
- `RewardCap`: Oversees reward configurations, ensuring precise management of reward distributions and parameters.
- `InviteCap`: Manages user onboarding through secure invite creation and validation processes.
- `MintCap`: Explicitly controls token minting capabilities, securely governing the issuance and supply management of tokens.

The deliberate separation of these administrative capabilities into modular components facilitates Sage’s progressive decentralization goals. As governance frameworks evolve, these capabilities will incrementally transition from centralized team management to fully decentralized community governance.

### **Governance Witness Pattern**

Central to Sage’s governance is a configurable witness-based authorization system. This approach employs specialized witness configurations to explicitly authorize governance actions at runtime, providing secure and verifiable governance interactions:

- `GovernanceWitnessConfig`: Defines authorized witness types explicitly for critical governance actions, ensuring that only approved entities can execute sensitive governance operations.

For example, runtime validation occurs through clear witness checks:

```
public fun update_mint_config_for_governance<GovernanceWitness: drop>(
    governance_witness: &GovernanceWitness,
    governance_witness_config: &GovernanceWitnessConfig,
    mint_config: &mut MintConfig,
    enabled: bool,
    max_supply: Option<u64>
) {
    access::assert_governance_witness(
        governance_witness,
        governance_witness_config
    );

    update_mint_config(
        mint_config,
        enabled,
        max_supply
    );
}
```

This explicit runtime verification ensures secure and authorized governance, effectively preventing unauthorized actions through precise witness validation.

### **Upgradeability and Flexibility**

A key strength of Sage’s governance architecture is the ability to dynamically update configurations securely without redeploying core protocol contracts. Administrative capabilities allow authorized administrators to adjust governance configurations, permissions, and settings securely at runtime:

```
public fun update_mint_config_admin(
    _: &MintCap,
    mint_config: &mut MintConfig,
    enabled: bool,
    max_supply: Option<u64>
) {
    update_mint_config(
        mint_config,
        enabled,
        max_supply
    );
}
```

This flexibility ensures the protocol can smoothly adapt to evolving ecosystem needs with minimal disruption.

### **Practical Architectural Benefits**

Sage’s governance architecture delivers multiple tangible advantages:

- **Modular Security:**\
  Administrative capabilities and witness configurations clearly compartmentalize control points, significantly limiting security risks through modular separation of privileges.
- **Transparent Decision-Making:**\
  Explicit governance witness configurations transparently document current administrative actions, providing auditable, verifiable visibility into Sage’s decision-making processes. While witness configurations alone don’t guarantee decentralization, they clearly document actions for transparent community oversight. True decentralized governance will be fully realized with the upcoming implementation of dedicated governance modules.
- **Runtime Security Enforcement:**\
  Sage’s witness-based pattern explicitly enforces security checks at runtime, validating every governance action immediately and precisely preventing unauthorized actions through type mismatches.
- **Adaptable Governance:**\
  Administrative and governance configurations can be dynamically updated at runtime, allowing the protocol to quickly and securely respond to changing ecosystem requirements without complex redeployments.
