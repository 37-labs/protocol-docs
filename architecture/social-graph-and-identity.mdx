Sage Protocol provides a decentralized, user-owned, and portable approach to managing digital identities, profiles, and social relationships, ensuring users retain complete control over their social interactions and connections across multiple applications.

### Architectural Approach to Identity Management

Sage manages decentralized identities entirely on-chain through a dual-object architecture that balances user sovereignty with social functionality. Each user identity consists of a private UserOwned object (containing personal data, analytics, and favorites) controlled exclusively by the wallet owner, and a public UserShared object (enabling follows, friendships, and posts) that facilitates social interactions across applications. This modular design ensures users maintain complete control over their core identity data while enabling rich social features like content creation, community engagement, and cross-app portability within Sage's decentralized ecosystem.

### Decentralized Social Graph Storage and Representation

Social relationships are stored and managed on-chain through structured membership systems that track follows, friendships, and community participation across different applications. The architecture distinguishes between various relationship types—from channel memberships and user follows to friend requests and friendships—with each connection maintaining its own state, history, and verification through on-chain recording. This on-chain social graph ensures relationship data remains portable, verifiable, and user-controlled while enabling rich social interactions across Sage's decentralized ecosystem.

Key advantages of this approach include:

- **Interoperability**: Users can effortlessly move their social identities and connections between various Sage-integrated applications.
- **Ownership and Control**: Users fully own and control their identity data, ensuring privacy and reducing reliance on centralized entities.
- **Censorship Resistance**: The decentralized structure ensures that social connections and identities cannot be arbitrarily restricted or removed.

### Practical Examples and Real-World Benefits

Sage’s decentralized social graph and identity infrastructure offer tangible advantages for various stakeholders:

- **Developers**: Easily integrate robust, decentralized social identity (“UserOwned”, “UserShared”) and relationship (“Follows”, “Friends”, “Membership”, etc) structures into new applications without extensive protocol-level modifications.
- **End-users**: Maintain consistent identity, reputation, and connections seamlessly across multiple decentralized platforms, enhancing user autonomy and reducing friction.
- **Ecosystem Interoperability**: Foster a rich, interconnected network of applications where user identity and relationships seamlessly interact across diverse experiences.
