## Structs

### Struct `Royalties`

Holds the configuration for how royalties may be paid out when fees are collected within the protocol.

```rust
public struct Royalties has key
```

<Expandable title="Fields">
  ```rust
    id: sui::object::UID,
    app: address,
    custom_coin_type: std::type_name::TypeName,
    partner_fee: u64,
    partner_treasury: address,
    protocol_fee: u64,
    protocol_treasury: address
  ```
</Expandable>

## Constants

Upper limit of what percentage can be collected by partner and protocol treasuries from a royalty payment, equivalent to 98%.

```rust
const FEE_LIMIT: u64 = 9800;
```

Scale used to determine the percentage for the `FEE_LIMIT`.

```rust
const SCALE: u64 = 10000;
```

Error encountered when attempting to set fee ranges within royalty payments that are out of bounds.

```rust
const EInvalidFeeValue: u64 = 370;
```

## Functions

### Function `collect_payment`

Transfers collected payments to the protocol treasury.

```rust
public fun collect_payment<CoinType>(custom_coin: Coin<CoinType>, sui_coin: Coin<SUI>)
```

<Expandable title="Implementation">
  ```rust
    public fun collect_payment<CoinType> (
        custom_coin: Coin<CoinType>,
        sui_coin: Coin<SUI>
    ) {
        transfer::public_transfer(
            custom_coin,
            @treasury
        );
  
        transfer::public_transfer(
            sui_coin,
            @treasury
        );
    }
  ```
</Expandable>

### Function `distribute_payment`

Transfers collected payments to the protocol treasury.

```rust
public fun distribute_payment<CoinType>(royalties: &Royalties, custom_payment: Coin<CoinType>, sui_payment: Coin<SUI>, recipient: address, ctx: &mut TxContext)
```

<Expandable title="Implementation">
  ```rust
