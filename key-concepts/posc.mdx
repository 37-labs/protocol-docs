Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) is Sage's mechanism designed to transparently identify, validate, and quantify genuine onchain social actions performed by users, providing a fair and verifiable method to recognize authentic contributions without relying on speculative or centralized assessments.

The process involves three steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Onchain User Action">
    A user performs an eligible action (e.g., publishing content, following another user, liking a post, or commenting). Because actions are onchain, each carries a transaction fee paid in \$SUI. Each action is also associated with a predefined weight that reflects its relative value to the network.
  </Step>
  <Step title="PoSC Evaluation">
    The PoSC engine: (1) validates the action, (2) converts the action’s transaction fee into its USD equivalent using live price oracles, and (3) calculates the precise \$TRUST reward based on (a) the USD value of the transaction fee, (b) the market price of of \$TRUST at the time of the action, and (c) the action’s assigned weighting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim & Mint">
    The calculated \$TRUST reward becomes immediately available for the user to claim and mint.
  </Step>
