## What is Sage?

Sage Protocol is a decentralized social protocol that transforms validated onchain social actions into transparent, real-time programmable rewards.

Traditional centralized social networks monopolize user value, pushing superficial engagement and opaque incentives. Even current Web3 social alternatives often repeat these mistakes—issuing tokens speculatively or relying heavily on centralized decision-making. Sage, however, takes a distinctly different path.

At its core, Sage introduces Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC), a unique mechanism that rewards genuine user participation by anchoring incentives directly to blockchain transaction fees paid in \$SUI. Unlike Proof-of-Work models that reward computational power or Proof-of-Stake methods benefiting capital holders, PoSC uniquely places authentic social engagement and validated actions at the center of reward allocation. Alongside PoSC is Sage’s foundational token, \$TRUST, crypto’s first Earned Mint Token (EMT). \$TRUST is minted exclusively through verified user activities—no pre-mines, speculative allocations, or arbitrary distributions—meaning every token directly reflects actual user effort and meaningful network growth.

For developers, Sage offers a modular smart-contract architecture designed for easy integration, interoperability, and composability—allowing rapid development of customized, engaging social applications. End-users benefit from transparent incentives, portable identity across apps, and more meaningful, authentic social interactions. Investors and stakeholders gain confidence from Sage’s sustainable economic model, which organically aligns token supply with real network activity and incorporates built-in scarcity mechanisms.

Every Sage transaction is anchored to verifiable blockchain actions and transparently calculated transaction costs, inherently safeguarding against Sybil attacks and ensuring fair reward distribution. This transparent economic model creates credibility, sustainability, and fairness, setting Sage apart as a genuinely decentralized alternative.

## Why Sage?

Traditional social platforms are fundamentally flawed—centralized entities monopolize user-generated value, superficial engagement is rewarded over meaningful interaction, and incentive structures remain opaque and misaligned. Even many decentralized Web3 alternatives today still suffer from speculative token economics, centralization risks, and lack transparency, offering users and developers little genuine improvement over existing centralized models.

Current decentralized social protocols often rely heavily on speculative rewards and pre-mined tokens, leading to artificial incentives and unsustainable economic structures. This model typically encourages short-term financial speculation rather than meaningful user contribution. Additionally, these platforms rarely provide true transparency or user ownership, often maintaining centralization in critical aspects such as social graph control and reward issuance.

Sage Protocol directly tackles these pervasive issues with innovative, transparent solutions. At the heart of Sage is the Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) mechanism, uniquely anchoring incentives directly to real blockchain transaction costs paid in \$SUI. PoSC replaces speculation-based token distribution with verifiable, transparent, and economically rational rewards. Sage introduces \$TRUST, crypto’s first Earned Mint Token (EMT), minted exclusively through validated social actions without pre-mines or arbitrary distributions. This ensures that token allocation is directly tied to actual user participation and meaningful community contributions.

The concrete benefits for each key stakeholder are significant:

<Card title="For Developers" icon="code">
  - Modular smart contracts simplify integration and foster rapid development.
  - Programmable reward mechanisms enhance flexibility, allowing developers to align incentives directly with user and community engagement.
</Card>

<Card title="For Users" icon="user-astronaut">
  - Fair and transparent incentives replace opaque, arbitrary rewards.
  - Portable, onchain identities and social graphs that users genuinely own, allowing seamless interaction across various decentralized applications.
  - A focus on meaningful engagement rather than superficial actions, enhancing community quality and authenticity.

Sage sets the stage for a healthier, transparent, and economically sound decentralized social ecosystem. By re-aligning economic incentives with genuine user contributions and meaningful interactions, Sage positions itself not only as a significant advancement in decentralized social networking but as a catalyst for broader crypto adoption, decentralized identity development, and the emergence of truly composable social infrastructure.
