## What's Sage?

Sage Protocol is a Sui-native infrastructure designed to turn everyday social activity into clear, verifiable economic value. Users benefit by earning direct rewards, building transparent reputations, and maintaining full control over their social identities and relationships. Developers can leverage Sage to easily create decentralized social apps powered by user-owned digital identities, existing onchain connections, rewarded interactions, and structured community channels.\
\
At the heart of Sage is the **Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)** model, which directly rewards users in real-time with **\$TRUST**—crypto’s first **Earned Mint Token (EMT)**. Unlike typical tokens, \$TRUST is minted only after validated user activities like posting content, engaging with content, and creating connections. Each reward is tied specifically to the transaction fees of user actions and balanced with predefined action weights. This system helps keep interactions fair, transparent, and genuinely engaging.\
\
Sage’s architecture is built around several key concepts: **Identity** (user-owned profiles), **Connections** (verifiable social graphs), **Posts** (blockchain-native content), **Channels** (community spaces), and **Rewards** (PoSC \+ \$TRUST). Developers can tap into these components using modular smart contracts and intuitive SDKs, making it straightforward to build, customize, and scale applications to fit their needs.
