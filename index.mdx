## What is Sage?

Sage Protocol is a decentralized social protocol that transforms validated onchain social actions into transparent, real-time programmable rewards.

Traditional centralized social networks monopolize user value, pushing superficial engagement and opaque incentives. Even current Web3 social alternatives often repeat these mistakes—issuing tokens speculatively or relying heavily on centralized decision-making. Sage, however, takes a distinctly different path.

At its core, Sage introduces Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC), a unique mechanism that rewards genuine user participation by anchoring incentives directly to blockchain transaction fees paid in \$SUI. Unlike Proof-of-Work models that reward computational power or Proof-of-Stake methods benefiting capital holders, PoSC uniquely places authentic social engagement and validated actions at the center of reward allocation. Alongside PoSC is Sage’s foundational token, \$TRUST, crypto’s first Earned Mint Token (EMT). \$TRUST is minted exclusively through verified user activities—no pre-mines, speculative allocations, or arbitrary distributions—meaning every token directly reflects actual user effort and meaningful network growth.

For developers, Sage offers a modular smart-contract architecture designed for easy integration, interoperability, and composability—allowing rapid development of customized, engaging social applications. End-users benefit from transparent incentives, portable identity across apps, and more meaningful, authentic social interactions. Investors and stakeholders gain confidence from Sage’s sustainable economic model, which organically aligns token supply with real network activity and incorporates built-in scarcity mechanisms.

Every Sage transaction is anchored to verifiable blockchain actions and transparently calculated transaction costs, inherently safeguarding against Sybil attacks and ensuring fair reward distribution. This transparent economic model creates credibility, sustainability, and fairness, setting Sage apart as a genuinely decentralized alternative.
