**Sage Protocol** provides foundational primitives for building decentralized applications with programmable social economies. Sage's architecture includes defined Social Primitives, including user-owned digital identities ([**Identity**](/concepts/1-identity)), verifiable onchain social graphs ([**Connections**](/concepts/3-connections)), blockchain-native content ([**Posts**](/concepts/2-posts)), and structured community spaces ([**Channels**](/concepts/4-channels)), combined with novel Economic Primitives like the [**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)**](/introduction/2-posc) incentive mechanism and crypto’s first [**Earned Mint Token**](/introduction/3-emt)**,** [**\$TRUST**](/introduction/4-trust).

The PoSC incentive engine is designed to transparently validate and reward users' onchain social activities. PoSC currently recognizes over 20 distinct actions, including content creation (text, images, videos), content engagement (likes, comments), network growth (follows, friendships), and community building (channel creation, membership expansion).

Sage lets developers build decentralized apps that put incentivized engagement front and center— turning social social activity into a core driver of value creation and community growth. Users benefit from clear incentives, instant rewards, reputation-building, and complete ownership of their digital identities and connections. Developers gain access to plug-and-play social and economic primitives, enabling them to craft engagement strategies that are perfectly aligned with their platform’s goals.
