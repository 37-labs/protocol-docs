**Sage Protocol** provides foundational primitives for building decentralized applications with programmable social economies. Sage's architecture includes defined Social Primitives, including user-owned digital identities ([**Identity**](/concepts/1-identity)), verifiable onchain social graphs ([**Connections**](/concepts/3-connections)), blockchain-native content ([**Posts**](/concepts/2-posts)), and structured community spaces ([**Channels**](/concepts/4-channels)), combined with novel Economic Primitives like the [**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)**](/introduction/2-posc) incentive mechanism and crypto’s first [**Earned Mint Token**](/introduction/3-emt)**,** [**\$TRUST**](/introduction/4-trust).

The PoSC incentive engine is designed to transparently validate and reward users' onchain social activities. PoSC currently recognizes over 20 distinct actions, including content creation (text, images, videos), content engagement (likes, comments), network growth (follows, friendships), and community building (channel creation, membership expansion).

With Sage, developers can easily integrate incentivized engagement into decentralized apps. Plug-and-play social and economic primitives transform social activity into a powerful driver of platform value and community growth—directly benefiting users with clear incentives, instant rewards, reputation-building, and complete ownership of their digital identities and connections.
