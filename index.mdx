**Sage Protocol** is a collection of primitives that enable developers to build decentralized applications with programmable social economies. To accomplish this, Sage's architecture includes clearly defined Social Primitives, including user-owned digital identities ([**Identity**](/concepts/1-identity)), verifiable onchain social graphs ([**Connections**](/concepts/3-connections)), blockchain-native content ([**Posts**](/concepts/2-posts)), and structured community spaces ([**Channels**](/concepts/4-channels)), combined with novel Economic Primitives like the [**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)**](/introduction/2-posc) incentive mechanism and crypto’s first [**Earned Mint Token**](/introduction/3-emt) ([**\$TRUST**](/introduction/4-trust)).

At the core of Sage is the PoSC incentive engine, designed to transparently validate and reward onchain social activities. PoSC currently recognizes over 20 distinct actions, including content creation (text, images, videos), content engagement (likes, comments), network growth (follows, friendships), and community building (channel creation, membership expansion).

With Sage, developers can easily build apps that incentivize engagement tailored precisely to their community’s objectives. Users benefit through transparent rewards, reputation building, and full ownership of their digital identities and social connections—making authentic user contribution and engagement the core drivers of value creation and sustainable community growth.
