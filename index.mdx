**Sage Protocol** provides foundational primitives for building decentralized applications with programmable social economies. Sage's architecture includes defined Social Primitives for user-owned digital identities ([**Identity**](/concepts/1-identity)), verifiable onchain social graphs ([**Connections**](/concepts/3-connections)), blockchain-native content ([**Posts**](/concepts/2-posts)), and structured community spaces ([**Channels**](/concepts/4-channels)), combined with novel Economic Primitives like the [**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)**](/introduction/2-posc) incentive mechanism and cryptoâ€™s first [**Earned Mint Token**](/introduction/3-emt)**,** [**\$TRUST**](/introduction/4-trust).

Sage's PoSC engine is designed to transparently track, validate, and reward users' onchain social activities, and currently recognizes over 20 distinct actions, including content creation (text, images, videos), content engagement (likes, comments), network growth (follows, friendships), and community building (channel creation, membership expansion).

With Sage, developers can easily integrate incentivized engagement into decentralized apps with plug-and-play building blocks that transform social actions into an embedded driver of value and community growth. This directly benefits users with clear incentives, instant rewards, reputation-building, and complete ownership of their digital identities and connections.

At its core, Sage's mission is quite simple:

> **Finally reward what's real.**
