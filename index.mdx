Sage Protocol's mission is simple:

> **Fairly reward social contributions that matter.**

To accomplish this, Sage provides foundational primitives for creating decentralized applications powered by programmable social economies. Its architecture combines Social Primitives, including user-owned digital identities ([**Identity**](/concepts/1-identity)), blockchain-native content ([**Posts**](/concepts/2-posts)), verifiable onchain social graphs ([**Connections**](/concepts/3-connections)), and structured community spaces ([**Channels**](/concepts/4-channels)), with novel Economic Primitives like the [**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)**](/introduction/2-posc) incentive mechanism and cryptoâ€™s first [**Earned Mint Token**](/introduction/3-emt)**,** [**\$TRUST**](/introduction/4-trust).

With Sage's plug-and-play building blocks, developers can easily embed incentivized social engagement into decentralized apps. This turns everyday social activities into powerful drivers of community growth, while providing users with clear incentives, immediate rewards, reputation-building opportunities, and true ownership of their digital identities and relationships.
