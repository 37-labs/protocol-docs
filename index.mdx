## What's Sage?

**Sage** is a decentralized protocol that transforms social activity into transparent, programmable user rewards. By instantly validating onchain social actions and trustlessly anchoring rewards to each action’s underlying transaction cost, Sage introduces a pioneering Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model that naturally incentivizes authentic user contributions and engagement.

Traditional centralized social platforms monopolize user-generated value, while existing Web3 alternatives merely recycle Web2 UX, relying heavily on superficial engagement tactics and opaque, misaligned incentives. Sage fully leverages crypto-native innovations to enable social platforms that break this mold, letting app developers align economic incentives directly with user actions to unlock new forms of social participation.

At Sage’s core is **Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)**—a novel incentive mechanism designed to reward virtually any eligible onchain social action, including content creation, meaningful interactions, and network building. PoSC powers the minting of **\$TRUST**, crypto’s first **Earned Mint Token (EMT)**, issued exclusively through authenticated user activity rather than pre-mines, arbitrary emission schedules, or speculative distributions.

Sage’s modular architecture provides intuitive, scalable building blocks, empowering developers and creators to easily build social apps that quantify and reward participant actions, fostering sustainable growth and deeper user engagement.

Through transparent validation, real-time incentives, and crypto-native economic alignment, Sage creates ecosystems where genuine social engagement is the primary catalyst of value creation and network growth.
