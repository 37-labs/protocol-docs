## What's Sage?

Sage Protocol provides primitives that empower developers to build decentralized applications with programmable social economies. Its architecture includes clearly defined Social Primitives, including user-owned digital identities (**Identity**), verifiable onchain social graphs (**Connections**), blockchain-native content (**Posts**), and structured community spaces (**Channels**), paired with novel Economic Primitives like the **Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)** incentive mechanism and crypto’s first Earned Mint Token (**\$TRUST**).

At the core of Sage is the PoSC incentive engine, designed to transparently validate and directly reward onchain social activities. PoSC currently recognizes over 20 unique social actions, such as creating posts (text, images, videos), engaging with content (likes, comments), expanding networks (follows, friendships), and fostering communities (channel creation, membership growth). Each validated action has an associated transaction fee and specific action weight. PoSC uses both to clearly determine rewards and grant users minting rights for \$TRUST tokens.

Because \$TRUST tokens are minted exclusively through validated user actions, the token’s circulating supply grows organically—without pre-mines, speculative issuance, or arbitrary emission schedules. This design enables developers to align economic incentives with user engagement and customize incentive structures according to their community-specific objectives. Users benefit from earning direct rewards, building transparent reputations, and retaining complete control over their social identities and relationships.

By instantly rewarding social activities, Sage makes it straightforward to build, customize, and scale engaging apps where meaningful user contributions and engagement directly drive value creation and community growth.
