## What's Sage?

Sage Protocol is a decentralized, blockchain-native infrastructure that transforms social interactions into verifiable economic value. Sage enables developers to build decentralized social applications leveraging user-owned digital identities, existing onchain relationships, incentivized posts and interactions, and clearly defined community channels.

At the core of Sage lies the [**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)**](/introduction/2-posc) model, explicitly rewarding users with immediate, transparent rewards in the form of **\$TRUST**—the first **Earned Mint Token (EMT)**. Unlike traditional tokens, \$TRUST tokens are only minted after validated user actions, such as posting content, forming connections, and participating actively in community channels. Rewards are anchored to the specific transaction fees associated with each user action, combined with predefined action weights. This approach ensures fairness and encourages authentic user engagement.

Sage’s architecture is built around clearly defined concepts for Identity (user-owned profiles), Connections (verifiable social graphs), Posts (blockchain-native content), and Channels (community spaces). Developers can interact with these components through modular smart contracts and SDKs, making it easy to integrate, customize, and expand applications according to their unique requirements. Additionally, Sage provides built-in administrative and moderation tools, allowing effective community management and ensuring a high-quality user experience throughout the platform.
