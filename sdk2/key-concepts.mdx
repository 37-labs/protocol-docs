### Application Context (`appID`)

Sage SDK explicitly requires each application to define a unique `appId`. This isolates content and interactions per app, ensuring that channels and content remain app-specific, while user identities remain global.

### Application Isolation

Sage explicitly isolates content and channels by application, using unique `appId`s. This ensures each app maintains distinct content and interactions. At the same time, user identities and social graphs remain globally consistent and accessible across all Sage-enabled apps.

### Error Handling

Sage SDK consistently returns a result object indicating success or failure. Always check the `ok` property before proceeding:

```typescript
if (result.ok) {
  // Success: use result.transaction
} else {
  // Error: handle result.err
  console.error(result.err);
}
```

This explicit error-handling approach applies consistently across all SDK operations.

### Invite-Based User Creation

User creation currently requires explicit invite codes and invite keys. This ensures controlled onboarding and allows applications to regulate their initial user base and interactions effectively.

### React Context and Hooks

The React integration leverages context and custom hooks (`useUser`, `useChannel`, `usePost`) for clean and simplified interaction with Sage's social primitives. This supports clear separation of concerns and easy state management.

### Transaction Patterns

All Sage SDK operations involving blockchain writes follow a consistent transaction workflow:

1. **Construct Transaction**\
   SDK methods return a transaction object, ready for signing.
2. **Sign and Execute**\
   Your application handles the user's wallet interactions to sign and execute the transaction.

```typescript
const result = await sageClient.createUser({
  amounts: [0, 0],
  name: "john-doe",
  description: "Web3 enthusiast",
  self: walletAddress
});

if (result.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: result.transaction });
}
```
