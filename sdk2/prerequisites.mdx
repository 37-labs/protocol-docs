Before using the Sage SDK, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js and npm:**\
  Ensure Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm are installed on your machine.
- **Sui Blockchain Wallet:**\
  Users and developers must have an active Sui blockchain wallet address to interact with Sage functionalities and sign transactions. Examples include [**Suiet**](https://suiet.app/), [**Phantom**](https://phantom.com/), [**Slush**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/slush-%E2%80%94-a-sui-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil), and more.
- **Invite Codes:**\
  User creation in the current version of the Sage SDK requires valid invite codes and invite keys provided by Sage.
- **Supported Network:**\
  Sage SDK supports two networks:
  - `mainnet` (production)
  - `testnet` (development/testing)
- **Sui Client:**\
  While the Sage SDK includes built-in client creation, developers can optionally reuse an existing Sui client (`SuiClient`) for enhanced performance and efficiency.
