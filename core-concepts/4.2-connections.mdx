title: "Connections"
description: "Decentralized Network Graph"
---

A transparent, onchain graph that captures user relationships—such as follows, friendships, invitations, and memberships. This decentralized structure ensures relationships remain fully participant-owned, portable, and composable across applications.

- **Relationship Objects**: Blockchain-recorded interactions that enable verifiable credibility, recommendations, and access control.
- **Cross-Application Portability**: Connections that seamlessly transfer across different platforms, preventing lock-in and encouraging integrated ecosystems.
- **Sybil-Resistance**: Relationship authenticity that’s grounded in economic effort (i.e., transaction fees), discouraging fake connections, spam, and gaming.

Applications can leverage these connections to deliver personalized recommendations, secure access controls, and more interconnected networks.
