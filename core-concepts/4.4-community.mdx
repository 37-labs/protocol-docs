Modular frameworks designed for transparent, incentivized community building. Communities built on Sage benefit from built-in incentives and verifiable memberships.

- **Onchain Communities**: Quickly create decentralized groups and channels with verifiable membership and transparent decision-making.
- **Customizable Participation**: Definable membership criteria (e.g., open, token-gated, or invitation-based) that enhances the power to shape community dynamics.
- **Integrated Incentives**: Direct integration with Sageâ€™s reward engine enhances incentives to join and rewards community engagement.
- **Transparent Governance**: Immutable records of community decisions and rules enhance trust and integrity.

These community structures serve as pillars for sustainable growth and more powerful user engagement.
