PoSC is a novel incentive mechanism that trustlessly converts validated social actions into economically anchored rewards.

## The PoSC Process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Onchain Social Action">
    A user performs an eligible action (e.g., publishing content, following another user, liking a post, or commenting). Because actions are onchain, each carries a transaction fee paid in \$SUI. Each action is also associated with a predefined weight that reflects its relative value to the network.
  </Step>
  <Step title="PoSC Evaluation">
    The PoSC engine:

    1. Validates the action
    2. Converts the action’s transaction fee into its USD equivalent using live price oracles,
    3. Calculates the precise \$TRUST reward based on: (a) The USD value of the transaction fee, (b) The market price of of \$TRUST at the time of the action, and (c) The action’s assigned weighting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim & Mint">
    The calculated \$TRUST reward becomes immediately available for the user to claim and mint.
  </Step>
