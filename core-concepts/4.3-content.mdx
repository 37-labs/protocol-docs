Decentralized content objects (e.g., text and rich media posts), recorded natively on the blockchain and empowering user ownership, portability, and monetization.

- **Content Ownership**: Users retain full control and portability over their content across applications.
- **Monetization**: Content interactions that can automatically trigger programmable \$TRUST rewards, incentivizing both creation and curation.
- **Verifiable Attribution**: Immutable onchain records that establish authenticity, protect creator rights, and prevent plagiarism.
- **Composable Integration**: Content objects that can be referenced and remixed by developers, fostering interoperability and unique user experiences.

These blockchain-native content features open new possibilities for digital expression, ownership, and monetization.
