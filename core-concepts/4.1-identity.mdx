A robust identity architecture comprising two integrated layers:

- **Global Soul-bound Identity:** A single, persistent, nontransferable blockchain identity fully owned and controlled by the user. This global identity layer includes essential user details (e.g., username, avatar, and bio), linked wallets, personalized metadata reflecting user interests, and credibility metrics derived from accumulated \$TRUST tokens.
- **App-Specific Profiles:** Designed to complement global identity, app-specific profiles enable customization tailored for individual applications. Users retain complete control, while applications can define specific data fields and privacy settings that match their particular use cases. Profiles can selectively inherit or override elements from the global identity, enabling nuanced reputation management.

Together, these two layers empower users with full ownership over their digital identities and reputations, fostering trust, transparency, and deeper engagement across the ecosystem.
