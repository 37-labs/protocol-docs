title: "Earned Mint Token (EMT)"
description: "Earned Mint Tokens (EMTs) are tokens minted exclusively through validated user actions, directly linking token supply with actual blockchain activity."

## EMT Principles:

- **Organic and Earned**: Token supply (i.e., minting of new tokens) emerges solely from verified onchain activities, clearly reflecting genuine user contributions and authentic network growth while eliminating arbitrary or speculative distributions.
- **Cost-anchored Economics**: Reward amounts directly correspond to the underlying \$SUI transaction fees, aligning incentives closely with user effort, while naturally discouraging spam and low-quality automated actions.
- **Transparent and Immediate Rewards**: Rewards are calculated transparently based on predefined, verifiable actions. Users can immediately claim and mint these rewards without depending on subjective assessments or centralized decisions.

By making user effort the main driver of token supply, EMTs create a sustainable incentive loop that amplifies and encourages real social activity.
