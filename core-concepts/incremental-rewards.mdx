Importantly, Sage prevents artificial reward inflation by using an **incremental reward minting model**. Under this model, high-impact actions (e.g., viral content posts) first generate a distinct reward tied to their transaction cost and valuation weight, and then accumulate additional rewards linearly based on subsequent engagement:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Content Publication">
    Generates a single reward explicitly linked to the action’s transaction fee and assigned weight.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow-up Interactions">
    Each engagement action (e.g., likes, shares, comments) on the original content generates incremental rewards linked to each engagement action’s transaction fee and assigned weight. These incremental rewards accrue to the original content creator, continually rewarding them as their content gains traction. Simultaneously, users performing these engagement actions also receive their own rewards, reflecting their active participation and contribution to network growth.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This approach clearly differentiates Sage from models that rely on subjective, opaque algorithms to value content impact.
