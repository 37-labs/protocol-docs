Sage's **Earned Mint Token (EMT)** model introduces a new, contribution-driven approach to token issuance. Unlike traditional tokens, EMTs are minted exclusively from validated user actions— eliminating pre-mines, arbitrary allocations, and speculative distributions. By anchoring token supply (i.e., rewards) to user effort and transaction fees, EMTs create clear incentives, naturally discourage spam, and allow immediate, decentralized reward claims. This approach encourages participation, builds stronger communities, and ensures token supply accurately reflects real network growth and user-generated value.

### Properties of an EMT

Every Earned Mint Token has three core characteristics:

  Tokens are minted exclusively from verified, onchain user actions, meaning token supply directly reflects genuine past effort and grows organically without arbitrary distributions.
</Card>

<Card title="Effort-Based" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
  Rewards are directly anchored to the transaction fee of each action, closely aligning incentives with real user effort and naturally preventing spam or superficial interactions.
</Card>

<Card title="Transparent and Immediate" icon="square-3" iconType="solid">
  Reward calculations are clear, verifiable onchain, and instantly claimable—no subjective or centralized decisions involved.
