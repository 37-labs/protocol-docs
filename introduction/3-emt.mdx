**The Earned Mint Token (EMT)** is a new kind of token introduced by Sage Protocol, designed specifically to reward authentic user contributions. Sage's EMT, known as \$TRUST, can only be minted by users themselves—and only when they perform genuine, verified social actions onchain. Each token is minted in precise amounts, directly corresponding to the rewards earned through validated activities. As a result, every \$TRUST token in circulation reflects real social value and meaningful user engagement.

Unlike traditional tokens, \$TRUST is never minted arbitrarily or speculatively. Instead, its supply emerges exclusively from measurable actions within the Sage network. These actions—including posting content, engaging with others, establishing connections, or participating in communities—are transparently validated through Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) system. After validation, users earn the right to mint a clearly defined amount of \$TRUST tokens at their convenience.

This approach ensures fairness by tying token issuance directly to genuine effort and economic activity. By closely linking token supply to verified user actions, Sage’s EMT model promotes authentic engagement, builds healthy communities, and accurately reflects real network growth and value.
