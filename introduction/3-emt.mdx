Sage's **Earned Mint Token (EMT)** model introduces a new approach to token issuance. Unlike traditional tokens, EMTs are minted solely through measurable, onchain user actions. Token supply therefore grows directly from verified user contributions, eliminating pre-mining, arbitrary allocations, and speculative distributions. Each EMT reward is calculated from the action's transaction fee, closely aligning incentives with real user effort, naturally deterring spam, and allowing users to immediately claim rewards without centralized decision making.

### Properties of an EMT

Every Earned Mint Token shares three essential qualities:

  Token supply emerges solely from verified, onchain user actions, ensuring genuine participation and eliminating arbitrary token distribution.
</Card>

<Card title="Cost-Anchored Economics" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
  Rewards directly reflect each actionâ€™s associated transaction fee, aligning incentives closely with user effort and naturally preventing spam or superficial interactions.
</Card>

<Card title="Transparent and Immediate" icon="square-3" iconType="solid">
  Reward calculations are clear, verifiable, and instantly available for users to claim, entirely removing subjective or centralized decisions.
</Card>

By directly linking token minting to authentic user effort and measurable activity, EMTs create a sustainable incentive loop. This approach encourages genuine participation, strengthens communities, and accurately reflects real network growth and user-generated value.
