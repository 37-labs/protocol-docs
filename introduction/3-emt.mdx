Sage's **Earned Mint Token (EMT)** model provides a new approach to token issuance. Unlike traditional tokens, EMTs are minted solely from measurable, onchain user actions. This ensures the token supply grows exclusively from verified user contributions—eliminating the need for pre-mining, arbitrary allocations, and speculative distributions. Each EMT reward is calculated based on the transaction fee associated with the rewarded action, aligning incentives closely with user effort, naturally deterring spam, and making rewards immediately available for users to claim without centralized or subjective decision making.

To qualify as an EMT, a token must have three core characteristics:

  Token supply emerges solely from verified, onchain user actions, ensuring genuine participation and eliminating arbitrary token distribution.
</Card>

<Card title="Cost-Anchored Economics" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
  Rewards directly reflect each action’s associated transaction fee, aligning incentives closely with user effort and naturally preventing spam or superficial interactions.
</Card>

<Card title="Transparent and Immediate" icon="square-3" iconType="solid">
  Reward calculations are clear, verifiable, and instantly available for users to claim, entirely removing subjective or centralized decisions.
</Card>

By directly linking token minting to authentic user effort and measurable economic activity, EMT models establish a sustainable incentive loop. This encourages ongoing participation, builds healthier communities, and closely mirrors real network growth and user-generated value.
