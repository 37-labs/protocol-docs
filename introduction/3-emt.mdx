**The Earned Mint Token (EMT)** is a novel token minting model introduced by Sage Protocol, explicitly designed to reward authentic, verified social contributions. Unlike traditional tokens minted arbitrarily or speculatively, EMT tokens can only be minted by users through measurable, onchain social actions—such as posting content, engaging meaningfully, or building genuine connections.

Earned Mint Tokens always follow three clear principles:

- **Earned and Organic:**\
  Token supply emerges solely from verified onchain activities, ensuring authenticity and eliminating arbitrary distributions.
- **Cost-Anchored Economics:**\
  Rewards directly reflect users' actual transaction costs, aligning incentives with genuine user effort and deterring spam.
- **Transparent and Immediate Rewards:**\
  Reward calculations are clear, verifiable, and instantly claimable by users, without centralized or subjective judgments.

By aligning token issuance closely with authentic effort and measurable economic activity, Sage’s EMT framework creates a sustainable incentive loop that fosters meaningful participation, builds healthier communities, and accurately represents genuine network growth and value. 

Sage Protocol’s implementation of EMT is exemplified through its native token, **\$TRUST**, detailed extensively in the following dedicated section.
