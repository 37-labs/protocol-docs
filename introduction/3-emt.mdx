The **Earned Mint Token (EMT)** model introduced by Sage Protocol offers a fresh way to mint tokens by explicitly rewarding authentic, verified social contributions. Unlike traditional tokens minted arbitrarily or based on speculation, EMT tokens are minted solely through measurable, onchain user activities—such as creating content, engaging meaningfully, or forming genuine connections.

Earned Mint Tokens always follow three clear principles:

  Token supply emerges and grows <u>only</u> from real, verified onchain actions.

  <Tip>
    Ensures that only authentic contribution is rewarded and removes arbitrary token issuance.

  Each reward directly reflects the rewarded action's transaction fee.

  <Tip>
    Ensures that incentives are aligned closely with actual user effort and naturally discourages spam.

<Card title="Transparent and Immediate Rewards" icon="square-3" iconType="solid">
  Rewards are openly calculated, easily verified, and instantly available for users to claim.

  <Tip>
    Ensures that rewards are free from centralized or subjective evaluation and inherently auditable.

By closely tying token minting to authentic effort and measurable economic activity, Sage’s EMT model creates a sustainable incentive loop that encourages genuine participation, fosters healthier communities, and accurately reflects real network growth and value.

Sage Protocol’s own EMT token, \$TRUST, is discussed in detail in the following section.
