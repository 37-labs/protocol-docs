Sage's **Earned Mint Token (EMT)** model introduces a new approach to token issuance—once driven entirely by measurable user contributions. Unlike traditional tokens, EMTs are minted exclusively through validated user actions, eliminating pre-mines, arbitrary allocations, and speculative distributions. By directly anchoring rewards to transaction fees and user effort, EMTs create clear incentives, naturally discourage spam, and ensure rewards are immediately claimable without centralized decision making. This approach encourages genuine participation, strengthens communities, and accurately reflects real network growth and user-generated value in the token itself.

### Properties of an EMT

Every Earned Mint Token has three core characteristics:

  Tokens are minted exclusively from verified, onchain user actions, meaning token supply directly reflects genuine past effort and grows organically without arbitrary distributions.

<Card title="Effort-Based" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
  Rewards are directly anchored to the transaction fee of each action, closely aligning incentives with real user effort and naturally preventing spam or superficial interactions.

<Card title="Transparent and Immediate" icon="square-3" iconType="solid">
  Reward calculations are clear, verifiable onchain, and instantly claimable—no subjective or centralized decisions involved.
