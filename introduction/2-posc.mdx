Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) is Sage Protocol's core incentive mechanism, explicitly rewarding users for authentic, onchain social actions. PoSC directly ties the minting of token rewards to measurable social activities and their associated transaction fees, anchoring incentives to verified user contributions and genuine economic value.

Eligible social actions—including creating posts, engaging with content (likes, comments), and forming connections—trigger PoSC rewards. Each reward is transparently calculated based on clearly defined criteria: the USD-equivalent value of the action's transaction fee, the current market price of \$TRUST tokens, and the specific action's weighting reflecting its value to the network.

Through PoSC, users gain the explicit right to mint a precise and predetermined amount of \$TRUST—the first Earned Mint Token (EMT)—corresponding exactly to the calculated reward amount for each verified action. Users can then mint this exact amount at their discretion, ensuring transparency, fairness, and accurate alignment between user contributions and earned rewards.

By directly linking token rewards to authentic user activities and their explicit economic costs, PoSC fosters sustainable, genuine social interactions, mitigates spam, and places verifiable community contributions at the core of Sage Protocol's economic model.
