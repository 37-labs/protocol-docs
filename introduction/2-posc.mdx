**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)** is Sage's core incentive mechanism, designed to reward authentic user actions by converting verified social activities directly into measurable economic value. Unlike Proof-of-Work, which favors those with powerful computing resources, or Proof-of-Stake, which benefits users holding large capital reserves, PoSC rewards the everyday user contributions that enrich social networks and communities.

PoSC transparently incentivizes a wide range of onchain social actions, including content creation (posts), meaningful engagement (likes, comments), network growth (follows, friendships), and community building (channel creation and member expansion). Every user action is clearly tied to verifiable transaction fees and predefined action weights, ensuring rewards fairly reflect each action’s contribution to the ecosystem.

### How PoSC Rewards Work

PoSC rewards follow a clear and transparent three-step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Action (Onchain)" iconType="solid">
    A user performs an eligible social action—such as posting content, engaging with others, or joining a channel. Because actions are performed explicitly onchain, users pay a transaction fee denominated in \$SUI. Each action carries a predefined weight reflecting its relative value to the community.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Calculation (PoSC Evaluation)">
    The PoSC engine verifies the action, converts the transaction fee into its USD equivalent using live price oracles, and calculates the precise \$TRUST reward. Reward calculation considers three criteria:

    - USD-equivalent value of the transaction fee paid.
    - Market price of \$TRUST at the action’s timestamp.
    - Action-specific weighting based on its community impact.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Minting Rewards">
    Users immediately gain the right to claim and mint their calculated reward amount of \$TRUST tokens—crypto’s first Earned Mint Token (EMT). Users mint rewards at their discretion, ensuring transparent, fair, and accurate compensation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

By directly linking token rewards to validated actions and their associated transaction costs, PoSC effectively discourages spam and superficial engagement, fostering ecosystems built around genuine user contributions.

### Rethinking Consensus: From Infrastructure to Individuals

Traditional blockchain consensus models like Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake inherently favor users with greater financial or hardware resources. PoSC shifts the paradigm, placing verified human effort and meaningful participation at the heart of network incentives, offering every user equal opportunities.

| Mechanism | Rewarded Resource          | Who Benefits            | Cost Basis            | Outcome                        |
| :-------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| PoW       | Computational power        | Miners                  | Energy consumption    | Network security               |
| PoS       | Staked capital             | Token holders           | Opportunity cost      | Validation                     |
| **PoSC**  | **Verified participation** | **Active contributors** | **Transaction costs** | **Ecosystem growth and trust** |

By directly aligning rewards with transparent, meaningful user engagement, PoSC ensures authentic human contributions become the central drivers of sustainable ecosystem growth and community value creation.
