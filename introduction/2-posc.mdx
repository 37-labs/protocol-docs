**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)** is Sage's novel incentive mechanism, designed to verify authentic onchain social activities and transparently convert eligible user actions into economic value. Unlike Proof-of-Work, which favors powerful computing resources, or Proof-of-Stake, which favors users with large capital reserves, PoSC rewards the everyday social contributions that enrich networks and communities.

At present, PoSC incentivizes more than 20 social actions, including content creation (creating a post), meaningful engagement (giving a like, adding a comment), network growth (following another user, friending a user), and community building (creating a channel, growing channel membership). See the full list of eligible social actions on the [\$TRUST Economics](/architecture/7-trust-economics) page.

### How PoSC Rewards Work

The PoSC process can be explained in three steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Action (Onchain)" iconType="solid">
    An eligible social action (e.g. posting content) is performed and recorded onchain, carrying a verifiable transaction fee denominated in \$SUI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Calculation (PoSC Evaluation)">
    The PoSC engine validates the action, records its associated transaction fee, and calculates the precise \$TRUST reward. The reward calculation considers two data points:

    - The value of the transaction fee paid
    - The value of \$TRUST at the action’s timestamp<sup>(1)</sup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Minting">
    Immediately following PoSC validation, users gain the right to claim and mint their \$TRUST reward, and can do so at their discretion.
  </Step>
</Steps>

_1) Since \$TRUST is an _[_Earned Mint Token_](/introduction/3-emt)_—meaning it's supply comes exclusively from verified, onchain user actions—it won't immediately have sufficient liquidity or a stable market price for accurate reward calculation. To address this, Sage calculates \$TRUST minting rewards in two phases: Phase 1: Bootstrap (using a fixed mint price), and Phase 2: Market (using a market-driven mint price). For full details, see the _[_\$TRUST_](/introduction/4-trust)_ section._

### Rethinking Consensus: From Infrastructure to Individuals

Traditional blockchain consensus models like Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake inherently favor users with greater financial or hardware resources. PoSC shifts the paradigm by placing verified human effort and meaningful participation at the heart of network incentives. In turn, every user has an equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from the ecosystem.

| Mechanism | Rewarded Resource          | Who Benefits            | Cost Basis            | Outcome                        |
| :-------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| PoW       | Computational power        | Miners                  | Energy consumption    | Network security               |
| PoS       | Staked capital             | Token holders           | Opportunity cost      | Validation                     |
| **PoSC**  | **Verified participation** | **Active contributors** | **Transaction costs** | **Ecosystem growth and trust** |

When rewards are aligned with transparent, meaningful user engagement, human contributions become the central drivers of sustainable ecosystem growth and community value creation.
