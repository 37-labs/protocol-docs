**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)** is at the heart of Sage, providing clear incentives for authentic social actions performed onchain. Rather than relying on vague metrics and subjective, centralized decision-making, PoSC directly connects token rewards to measurable social activities and their associated transaction costs, aligning incentives closely with genuine user contributions and real economic value.

Activities like creating posts, interacting through likes or comments, and making new connections all qualify for PoSC rewards. Each reward is transparently calculated using straightforward criteria: the transaction fee, the current market price of \$TRUST tokens, and the specific action's weighting based on its value to the community.

Through PoSC, users earn the explicit right to mint a specific amount of \$TRUSTâ€”crypto's first Earned Mint Token (EMT). Users can mint exactly the calculated reward whenever they choose, ensuring transparency, fairness, and a clear connection between effort and reward.

By anchoring token rewards directly to verified user actions and their explicit costs, PoSC promotes genuine social interactions, discourages spam, and puts authentic contributions at the very center of Sage Protocol's economy.
