**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)** is designed to reward social activity by converting verified and measurable user contributions into economic value. Unlike Proof-of-Work, which favors those with powerful computing resources, or Proof-of-Stake, which benefits users holding large capital reserves, PoSC rewards the everyday social contributions that enrich networks and communities.

PoSC incentivizes a wide range of onchain social actions, including content creation (posts), meaningful engagement (likes, comments), network growth (follows, friendships), and community building (channel creation and member expansion). Every user action is directly tied to its verifiable transaction fee and predefined action weight, ensuring rewards accurately reflect each action’s contribution to the ecosystem.

  To see the full list of eligible social actions and their corresponding weights, refer to the Action Weighting Model section on the [\$TRUST Economics](/architecture/7-trust-economics) page.

### How PoSC Rewards Work

The PoSC rewards engine can be explained in three steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Action (Onchain)" iconType="solid">
    A user performs an eligible social action (e.g., posting content, liking content, or joining a channel). Because actions are performed and recorded onchain, they carry a verifiable transaction fee denominated in \$SUI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Calculation (PoSC Evaluation)">
    The PoSC engine validates the action, converts the transaction fee into its USD equivalent using live price oracles, and calculates the precise \$TRUST reward. The reward calculation considers three criteria:

    - USD-equivalent value of the transaction fee paid
    - Price of \$TRUST at the action’s timestamp _(see _[_\$TRUST_](/introduction/4-trust)_ for additional details)_
    - Action-specific weighting based on its community impact _(see Action Weighting Model for additional details)_
  </Step>
  <Step title="Minting Rewards">
    Users immediately gain the right to claim and mint their calculated reward amount of \$TRUST tokens—crypto’s first Earned Mint Token (EMT). Users mint rewards at their discretion.
  </Step>
</Steps>

With rewards linked to validated actions and their associated transaction costs, PoSC discourages spam and superficial engagement while fostering ecosystems built around genuine user contributions.

### Rethinking Consensus: From Infrastructure to Individuals

Traditional blockchain consensus models like Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake inherently favor users with greater financial or hardware resources. PoSC shifts the paradigm by placing verified human effort and meaningful participation at the heart of network incentives. In turn, every user has an equal opportunity to participate in, and benefit from, the ecosystem.

| Mechanism | Rewarded Resource          | Who Benefits            | Cost Basis            | Outcome                        |
| :-------- | :------------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| PoW       | Computational power        | Miners                  | Energy consumption    | Network security               |
| PoS       | Staked capital             | Token holders           | Opportunity cost      | Validation                     |
| **PoSC**  | **Verified participation** | **Active contributors** | **Transaction costs** | **Ecosystem growth and trust** |

By directly aligning rewards with transparent, meaningful user engagement, PoSC ensures authentic human contributions become the central drivers of sustainable ecosystem growth and community value creation.
