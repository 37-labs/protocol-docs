**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)** is Sage's novel incentive mechanism, designed to verify user social activities and convert eligible actions into economic value. Unlike Proof-of-Work, which favors powerful computing resources, or Proof-of-Stake, which favors users with large capital reserves, PoSC rewards the everyday social contributions that enrich networks and communities.

PoSC currently incentivizes more than 15 social actions, including content creation (creating a post), meaningful engagement (giving a like, adding a comment), network growth (following or friending another), and community building (creating a channel, growing channel members). You can find the full list of eligible social actions in the Eligible Social Actions and Action Weights section of the [\$TRUST Mechanics](/architecture/7-trust-mechanics) page.

### How PoSC Rewards Work

The PoSC process can be explained in three steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Action (Onchain)" iconType="solid">
    An eligible social action (e.g. posting content) is performed and recorded onchain, carrying a verifiable transaction fee denominated in \$SUI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Calculation (PoSC Evaluation)">
    The PoSC engine validates the action, records its associated transaction fee, and calculates the precise \$TRUST reward. The reward calculation considers two data points:

    - The value of the transaction fee paid
    - The value of \$TRUST at the action’s timestamp

    <Info>
      Since \$TRUST is an [Earned Mint Token](/introduction/3-emt)—meaning it's supply emerges only from verified, onchain user actions—Sage will use a fixed mint price to calculate rewards during the bootstrap phase (Phase 1). After \$TRUST reaches sufficient liquidity and a stable market price, the protocol will transition to using a market-driven mint price for reward calculations (Phase 2). See full details for the minting phases in the [\$TRUST](/introduction/4-trust) section.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Minting">
    Immediately following PoSC validation, users are granted the right to mint their proportional \$TRUST rewards, and can do so at their discretion.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Incremental Engagement Rewards**

Subsequent content interactions (e.g., likes, shares, comments) are verified by the PoSC engine as independent actions that generate additional rewards. Each verified interactions generates additional \$TRUST minting rights (i.e., rewards) to the original content creator. Users engaging with content also receive proportional rewards, further encouraging community involvement.

### Rethinking Consensus: From Infrastructure to Individuals

Traditional blockchain consensus models like Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake inherently favor users with greater financial or hardware resources. PoSC shifts the paradigm by placing verified human effort and meaningful participation at the heart of network incentives. In turn, every user starts with an equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from the ecosystem. When rewards are aligned with transparent, meaningful engagement, user social activity becomes a central driver of sustainable ecosystem growth and value creation.
