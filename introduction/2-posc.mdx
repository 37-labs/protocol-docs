**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)** is Sage's novel incentive mechanism that turns verified social activity directly into economic rewards. Unlike Proof-of-Work, which favors powerful computing resources, or Proof-of-Stake, which favors users with large capital reserves, PoSC rewards the everyday social contributions that enrich networks and communities.

PoSC currently recognizes [13 social actions](https://docs.sageprotocol.xyz/introduction/4-trust#current-eligible-actions-and-action-weights), including content creation (creating a post), meaningful engagement (giving a like, adding a comment), network growth (following or friending another), and community building (creating a channel, growing channel members).

### How PoSC Rewards Work

The PoSC process can be explained in three steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Action (Onchain)" iconType="solid">
    A social action (e.g. posting content) is performed and recorded onchain, carrying a verifiable transaction fee denominated in \$SUI.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Calculation (PoSC Evaluation)">
    The PoSC engine determines its eligibility, validates the social action, records its associated transaction fee, and calculates the precise \$TRUST reward. The reward calculation considers two data points:

    1. The value of the transaction fee paid.
    2. The [value of \$TRUST](https://docs.sageprotocol.xyz/architecture/7-trust-economics#%24trust-minting-phases-%26-pricing-mechanics) at the actionâ€™s timestamp.
    3. The action's [assigned weight](https://docs.sageprotocol.xyz/introduction/4-trust#current-eligible-actions-and-action-weights).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Minting">
    Immediately following the PoSC evaluation, users are granted the right to mint their proportional \$TRUST rewards at their discretion.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Incremental Engagement Rewards**

Subsequent content interactions (e.g., likes, shares, comments) are verified by the PoSC engine as independent actions that generate additional rewards. Each verified interactions generates additional \$TRUST minting rights (i.e., rewards) to the original content creator. Users engaging with content also receive proportional rewards, further encouraging community involvement.

### Rethinking Consensus: From Infrastructure to Individuals

Traditional blockchain consensus models like Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake inherently favor users with greater financial or hardware resources. PoSC shifts the paradigm by placing verified human effort and meaningful participation at the heart of network incentives. In turn, every user starts with an equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from the ecosystem. When rewards are aligned with transparent, meaningful engagement, user social activity becomes a central driver of sustainable ecosystem growth and value creation.
