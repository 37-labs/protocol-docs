**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)** is Sage's native incentive mechanism that provides clear, fair rewards by converting verified user efforts directly into measurable economic value. Unlike Proof-of-Work, which rewards computational power (favoring those with the most powerful machines), or Proof-of-Stake, which rewards wealth (favoring those with the deepest pockets), PoSC explicitly rewards the onchain user activities that genuinely enrich and grow social networks.

PoSC incentivizes a broad range of social actions, including publishing content (posts), meaningful interactions (likes, comments), network expansion (follows, friendships), and community development (channel creation and member growth). The mechanism is transparent, straightforward, and entirely onchain, ensuring every user action is explicitly linked to verifiable economic inputs (transaction fees) and clearly assigned action weights reflecting their relative value to the ecosystem.

### The PoSC Reward Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Onchain User Action" iconType="solid">
    A user performs an eligible social action onchain, paying a transaction fee denominated in \$SUI. Each action type carries a predefined weighting that quantifies its relative community value.
  </Step>
  <Step title="PoSC Evaluation">
    The PoSC engine verifies the authenticity of the action, converts the associated transaction fee into its USD equivalent using live price oracles, and calculates the exact \$TRUST reward based on three explicit criteria:

    - The USD value of the transaction fee paid.
    - The market price of \$TRUST tokens at the action's timestamp.
    - The specific action weighting representing its network contribution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim & Mint">
    Users immediately gain the explicit right to claim and mint the calculated reward amount of \$TRUST tokens—crypto’s first Earned Mint Token (EMT). Users can mint their rewards at their discretion, ensuring direct transparency and fairness.
  </Step>
</Steps>

By anchoring rewards explicitly to verified actions and their associated economic costs, PoSC effectively prevents spam and superficial engagement, creating ecosystems centered on genuine user contributions. 

### Rethinking Consensus: From Infra to Individuals

Unlike other consensus mechanisms, PoSC ensures equal opportunity for all users, rewarding active participation rather than financial or hardware advantages.

| Mechanism | Rewarded Resource      | Who Benefits        | Cost Basis         | Outcome                    |
| :-------- | :--------------------- | :------------------ | :----------------- | :------------------------- |
| **PoW**   | Computational power    | Miners              | Energy consumption | Network security           |
| **PoS**   | Staked capital         | Token holders       | Opportunity cost   | Validation                 |
| **PoSC**  | Verified participation | Active contributors | Transaction costs  | Ecosystem growth and trust |

By aligning user participation directly with transparent economic incentives, PoSC places authentic human contributions at the core of network value creation and sustainable community growth.
