**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)** is Sage's novel incentive mechanism that turns verified social activity directly into economic rewards. Unlike Proof-of-Work, which favors powerful computing resources, or Proof-of-Stake, which favors users with large capital reserves, PoSC rewards the everyday social contributions that enrich networks and communities.

PoSC currently recognizes [13 social actions](https://docs.sageprotocol.xyz/introduction/4-trust#current-eligible-actions-and-action-weights), including content creation (creating a post), meaningful engagement (giving a like, adding a comment), network growth (following or friending another), and community building (creating a channel, growing channel members).

### How PoSC Rewards Work

The PoSC process involves three simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Social Action" iconType="solid">
    A user performs an action (like posting content), which is recorded onchain along with its associated \$SUI transaction fee.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluation & Calculation">
    The PoSC engine checks the actions eligibility, validates it, and calculates the exact \$TRUST reward based on:

    1. The transaction fee paid.
    2. The market price of \$TRUST at the time of the action.
    3. The action's [assigned weight](https://docs.sageprotocol.xyz/introduction/4-trust#current-eligible-actions-and-action-weights).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reward Minting">
    Once validated, users can immediately claim and mint their calculated \$TRUST rewards.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Incremental Engagement Rewards**

Sage recognizes that high-quality content often continues generating value beyond its initial posting. To reward sustained engagement, Sage employs an incremental reward model. After initial content creation, subsequent user interactions (e.g., likes, comments, or shares) are individually verified by the PoSC engine as distinct, reward-eligible actions. Each interaction triggers additional \$TRUST rewards, granting further minting rights directly to the original content creator, effectively rewarding creators for content that continues to resonate.

In parallel, users who engage by interacting with content also earn their own proportional rewards. This dual reward mechanism creates a dynamic incentive loop, driving continuous community interaction, amplifying the visibility of valuable content, and fairly recognizing all users who contribute to the ecosystemâ€™s vibrancy and growth.

### Rethinking Consensus: From Infrastructure to Individuals

Traditional blockchain consensus models like Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake naturally favor users who have more money or better hardware. PoSC flips this approach by putting verified human effort and genuine participation at the center of network incentives. As a result, every user has an equal chance to contribute to, and benefit from, the ecosystem. By transparently rewarding meaningful engagement, PoSC turns authentic social activity into the key driver of sustainable ecosystem growth and value creation.
