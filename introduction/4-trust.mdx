The economic core of Sage Protocol is the \$TRUST token, crypto's first Earned Mint Token (EMT). Unlike typical tokens, which are minted and allocated arbitrarily, \$TRUST is only minted after users execute social actions that are validated by Sage's Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) engine.

By directly linking token supply to measurable user effort, Sage creates a self-sustaining incentive loop that promotes authentic engagement and ensures that \$TRUST tokens accurately represent genuine social value, reputation, and meaningful participation within the community.

**Phase 1: Fixed \$TRUST Price**

Because \$TRUST’s supply emerges entirely from verified user contributions, the token will initially lack liquidity and a reliable market valuation. With this in mind, Sage establishes a fixed minting price for \$TRUST during the protocol’s bootstrap phase, ensuring predictable and fair rewards for early participants. During this initial period, reward calculations use the following transparent formula:

<Info>
  Phase 1 \$TRUST reward = (Action’s Transaction Fee ÷ **Fixed \$TRUST Price**) × Action Weight
</Info>

**Phase 2: Market-Driven \$TRUST Price**

As the protocol matures and \$TRUST achieves sufficient liquidity and a stable market valuation, the PoSC engine transitions to a dynamic, market-driven minting price:

<Info>
  Phase 2 \$TRUST reward = (Action’s Transaction Fee ÷ **Market \$TRUST Price**) × Action’s Weight
</Info>

This shift introduces natural token scarcity: as the market value of \$TRUST rises, fewer tokens are minted for identical actions compared to periods of lower valuation.

The market-driven reward calculation maintains a tight coupling between token supply and actual network contributions, establishing a sustainable, self-regulating economy. This approach fosters attractive supply-demand dynamics, increasing token scarcity organically as network value grows. Such dynamics reward early participation and incentivize continued, authentic engagement—ensuring long-term sustainability.
