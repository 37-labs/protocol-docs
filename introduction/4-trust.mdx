The economic core of Sage Protocol is the **\$TRUST** token, which is crypto's first Earned Mint Token (EMT). Unlike typical tokens, \$TRUST tokens aren't created arbitrarily and can only be minted when users perform verified social actions that are validated through Sage's Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) engine.

As users build up \$TRUST, it becomes a reliable measure of their reputation across the network. Having more \$TRUST can unlock special access, additional privileges, and future opportunities to participate in governance decisions within the Sage ecosystem.

To support steady initial growth, Sage establishes a stable starting price for minting tokens. This initial fixed price is explicitly used when calculating how much \$TRUST users receive for each contribution. Specifically, rewards are calculated using the formula:

<Info>
  \$TRUST reward = (Action’s Transaction Fee ÷ **Fixed \$TRUST Price**) × Action Weight
</Info>

Initially, this fixed \$TRUST minting price provides predictability, fairness, and clarity for early adopters and participants. Over time, as the protocol matures and \$TRUST establishes market liquidity, Sage will transition to a dynamic, market-driven minting price:

<Info>
  \$TRUST reward = (Action’s Transaction Fee ÷ **Market \$TRUST Price**) × Action’s Weight
</Info>

 This phased approach ensures token rewards always accurately reflect user contributions and support long-term economic sustainability.

_Detailed economic mechanics, minting phases, and action weighting are covered extensively in the dedicated "\$TRUST Economics" section._
