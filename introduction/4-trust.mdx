The economic foundation of Sage Protocol is the **\$TRUST token**, crypto's first Earned Mint Token (EMT). Unlike traditional tokens, which often rely on arbitrary distributions or speculative allocations, \$TRUST tokens are minted exclusively through authentic user actions verified by Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) engine.

By directly linking token issuance to measurable, onchain user activities, Sage establishes a sustainable incentive loop that promotes genuine user engagement. This ensures \$TRUST tokens precisely represent authentic social contributions, credible user reputations, and meaningful user participation.

### \$TRUST Minting Phases

Sage Protocol structures \$TRUST minting explicitly across two distinct phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Phase 1: Fixed Mint Price (Bootstrap Phase)" iconType="regular">
    Initially, as \$TRUST supply emerges exclusively from real user contributions, immediate liquidity and stable market pricing won't be present. To ensure predictable and fair rewards for early adopters, Sage will set a fixed mint price during its bootstrap phase. Rewards are calculated as:

    <Info>
      \$TRUST reward = (Action’s Transaction Fee ÷ **Fixed \$TRUST Price**) × Action Weight
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phase 2: Market-driven Mint Price">
    Once the protocol matures and \$TRUST achieves sufficient liquidity and a stable market valuation, Sage transitions to a dynamic, market-based mint price. Reward calculations then adapt to market conditions using:

    <Info>
      \$TRUST reward = (Action’s Transaction Fee ÷ **Market \$TRUST Price**) × Action’s Weight
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

This transition introduces natural token scarcity: as the market price of \$TRUST rises, fewer tokens are minted for the same action, organically adjusting supply based on network growth and economic conditions.

By aligning minting directly with validated user actions and responsive market pricing, Sage creates a self-regulating economy characterized by favorable supply-demand dynamics. This approach incentivizes early participation, rewards authentic engagement, and ensures long-term economic sustainability.
