The economic foundation of Sage Protocol is the **\$TRUST** token, crypto's first Earned Mint Token (EMT). Unlike typical tokens, \$TRUST can only be minted through authentic user actions verified by Sage’s [Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)](/introduction/2-posc) engine.

By directly linking token issuance to measurable, onchain user activities, Sage creates a sustainable incentive loop that fosters genuine user engagement. This ensures \$TRUST tokens accurately represent authentic social contributions, credible reputations, and meaningful participation.

Aligning minting with validated user actions and responsive market pricing enables Sage to create a self-regulating economy with favorable supply-demand dynamics. This approach incentivizes early involvement, rewards authentic interactions, and supports long-term economic sustainability.

### \$TRUST Minting Phases

Sage Protocol structures \$TRUST minting across two distinct phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Phase 1: Fixed Mint Price (Bootstrap Phase)" iconType="regular">
    Initially, as \$TRUST supply emerges exclusively from real user contributions, immediate liquidity and stable market pricing won't be present. To ensure predictable and fair rewards for early adopters, Sage will set a fixed mint price of **\$0.000001 USD** during its bootstrap phase. Rewards are calculated as:

    <Info>
      \$TRUST reward = (Action’s Transaction Fee ÷ **Fixed \$TRUST Price**) × Action Weight
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phase 2: Market-driven Mint Price">
    Once the protocol matures and \$TRUST achieves sufficient liquidity and a stable market valuation, Sage transitions to a dynamic, market-based mint price. Reward calculations then adapt to market conditions using:

    <Info>
      \$TRUST reward = (Action’s Transaction Fee ÷ **Market \$TRUST Price**) × Action’s Weight
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

The transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 naturally introduces natural token scarcity: as the market price of \$TRUST rises, fewer tokens are minted for the same action. This organically tethers circulating supply to network growth and economic conditions.
