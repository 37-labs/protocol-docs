The economic foundation of Sage Protocol is the \$TRUST token—crypto's first Earned Mint Token (EMT). Unlike traditional tokens, which are often created and distributed arbitrarily, \$TRUST tokens are minted exclusively through user actions verified by Sage's Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model.

By directly tying token issuance to measurable user activities, Sage establishes a sustainable incentive loop. This encourages genuine engagement and ensures \$TRUST tokens accurately represent authentic social contributions, reputations, and meaningful community participation.

**Phase 1: Fixed \$TRUST Price**

Initially, because \$TRUST tokens can only come from real user contributions, there won’t be immediate liquidity or a stable market price. To address this, Sage sets a fixed minting price during its bootstrap phase. This guarantees predictable, fair rewards for early contributors. Rewards during this initial phase use a clear formula:

<Info>
  Phase 1 \$TRUST reward = (Action’s Transaction Fee ÷ **Fixed \$TRUST Price**) × Action Weight
</Info>

**Phase 2: Market-Driven \$TRUST Price**

As the protocol grows and \$TRUST gains sufficient liquidity and stable market valuation, Sage transitions to a dynamic, market-based mint price. Rewards are then calculated using:

<Info>
  Phase 2 \$TRUST reward = (Action’s Transaction Fee ÷ **Market \$TRUST Price**) × Action’s Weight
</Info>

This transition naturally introduces scarcity: when \$TRUST’s market value rises, fewer tokens are minted for the same action compared to periods of lower valuation.

By aligning token minting directly with real user contributions and market conditions, Sage creates a self-regulating economy. This system generates attractive supply-demand dynamics, organically increases token scarcity as the network grows, rewards early adopters, and sustains long-term authentic participation.

Further details about token economics, minting phases, and how actions are weighted can be found in the dedicated "\$TRUST Economics" section.
