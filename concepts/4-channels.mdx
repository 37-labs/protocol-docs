**Channels** in Sage Protocol are decentralized community spaces designed for flexible membership, transparent incentives, and customizable interactions. Built to be fully composable, Channels integrate easily with Sage-compatible apps, enabling open communities and seamless cross-app engagement.

### Key Features of Channels:

<Card title="Onchain Identity and Customization">
  - Each channel is a unique blockchain entity, clearly defined by metadata:
    - Avatars and banners
    - Descriptions and names
  - Transparently communicates channel purpose, values, and focus.
</Card>

<Card title="Flexible Membership Rules">
  - Channels support customizable membership conditions:
    - Fee-based access (paid in \$SUI)
    - Invite-only participation
  - Enables creators to precisely tailor community criteria to their objectives.
</Card>

<Card title="Built-In Economic Incentives">
  - Integrated directly with Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC).
  - Members earn explicit rewards in \$TRUST tokens for verified social interactions.
  - Incentivizes genuine participation and authentic community engagement.
</Card>

<Card title="Dedicated Content Feeds">
  - Provides blockchain-native content feeds.
  - Users post, comment, and engage transparently, maintaining ownership and verifiable content attribution.
</Card>

<Card title="Robust Administrative Controls">
  - Comprehensive moderation tools for channel administrators:
    - Moderator management
    - User membership oversight
    - Enforcement of clear community guidelines
  - Ensures consistently high-quality social interactions.
</Card>

<Card title="Transaction Fee Sponsorship">
  - Enables apps to subsidize or fully sponsor user transaction fees.
  - Reduces barriers to participation, promoting sustained community engagement.
</Card>

<Card title="Cross-App Composability">
  - Channels have global visibility across the Sage ecosystem.
  - Users can seamlessly participate from multiple apps.
  - Developers can easily integrate, reference, and build upon existing channels, enhancing interconnected user experiences.
</Card>

### Future Roadmap

- **Community Governance**: Upcoming protocol updates will introduce decentralized governance mechanisms, allowing channel members to collaboratively shape channel policies and actively influence broader protocol decisions—promoting transparency, participation, and community-driven evolution.
