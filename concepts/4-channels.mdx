**Channels** in Sage Protocol are decentralized community spaces designed for flexible membership, transparent incentives, and customizable interactions. Built to be fully composable, Channels integrate easily with Sage-compatible apps, enabling open communities and seamless cross-app engagement.

### Key Features of Channels:

- **Onchain Identity and Customization**\
  Each channel exists explicitly as a unique blockchain entity, clearly defined by metadata such as avatars, banners, descriptions, and names, transparently communicating its purpose, values, and focus.
- **Flexible Membership Rules**\
  Channels support customizable membership options, including fee-based participation (paid via \$SUI tokens) or invite-only access. This flexibility empowers creators to establish community participation criteria tailored precisely to their goals.
- **Built-In Economic Incentives**\
  Integrated with Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model, channels explicitly reward members with \$TRUST tokens for verified interactions. This built-in incentive structure encourages meaningful participation and authentic community engagement.
- **Dedicated Content Feeds**\
  Channels provide blockchain-native feeds where users transparently post, comment, and interact—maintaining complete ownership and verifiable attribution of their content.
- **Robust Administrative Controls**\
  Channel administrators possess comprehensive moderation capabilities, including managing moderators, overseeing user memberships, and enforcing clear community guidelines to maintain a high-quality social environment.
- **Transaction Fee Sponsorship**\
  Sage Protocol explicitly enables applications to subsidize or sponsor user transaction fees, reducing participation friction and encouraging sustained engagement within the community.
- **Cross-App Composability**\
  While channels are created within specific applications, their global visibility within the Sage ecosystem allows seamless participation from users across multiple apps. Developers can effortlessly integrate, reference, and expand upon existing channels, facilitating interconnected and rich user experiences.

### Future Roadmap

- **Community Governance**: Upcoming protocol updates will introduce decentralized governance mechanisms, allowing channel members to collaboratively shape channel policies and actively influence broader protocol decisions—promoting transparency, participation, and community-driven evolution.
