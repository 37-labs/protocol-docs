A **Channel** in Sage Protocol is a decentralized, onchain community space designed for flexible memberships, transparent rewards, and customizable interactions. Channels are fully composable, allowing easy integration between community spaces and apps built on Sage.

Key features of Sage Channels include:

<Card title="Onchain Identity and Customization">
  Every channel exists as a unique blockchain entity with clearly defined metadata—including avatars, banners, descriptions, and channel names—that transparently communicates its purpose and values.
</Card>

<Card title="Flexible Membership Rules">
  Channels offer multiple ways to join, such as fee-based memberships (via \$SUI tokens) and invite-only access. This lets channel creators tailor participation rules specifically to their community’s objectives.
</Card>

<Card title="Built-In Economic Incentives">
  Integrated directly with Sage's Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model, channels transparently reward participants with \$TRUST tokens for verified interactions, encouraging genuine community engagement.
</Card>

<Card title="Channel-Specific Content and Feeds">
  Channels provide dedicated blockchain-native content feeds where users can post, comment, and engage transparently, retaining complete ownership of their content.
</Card>

<Card title="Administrative Controls">
  Channel administrators have comprehensive moderation tools, allowing them to manage moderators, user memberships, and enforce clear community guidelines and standards.
</Card>

<Card title="Transaction Fee Sponsorship">
  Sage Protocol allows applications to subsidize user transaction fees, reducing friction for participants and enhancing engagement at the application level.
</Card>

<Card title="Cross-App Composability">
  Channels originate within specific apps but remain openly accessible throughout the entire Sage ecosystem. Users with global identities can participate seamlessly in channels across multiple applications. This composability enables developers to effortlessly integrate, reference, and build upon existing channels—promoting interconnected, rich user experiences.
</Card>

### Future Roadmap

<Card title="Community Governance">
  Upcoming updates will introduce decentralized governance features, enabling channel members to collaboratively shape channel policies and influence broader protocol decisions.
