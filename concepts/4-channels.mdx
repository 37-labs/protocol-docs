A **Channel** in Sage Protocol represents a decentralized, onchain community structure designed for flexible membership, transparent incentives, and customizable interactions. Channels are fully composable, enabling seamless integration between community structures and applications built on Sage.

Key features of Sage Channels include:

- **Onchain Identity and Customization**\
  Each Channel is an onchain entity defined by unique metadata—such as avatars, banners, descriptions, and channel names—that communicate the channel’s purpose and values transparently.
- **Flexible Membership Rules**\
  Channels support customizable joining methods, including fee-based membership (paid via \$SUI) and invite-based participation. This enables channel creators to tailor participation requirements precisely to their community goals.
- **Built-In Economic Incentives**\
  Integrated with Sage's Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model, Channels transparently reward users with \$TRUST tokens for their verified interactions, incentivizing meaningful community engagement.
- **Channel-Specific Content and Feeds**\
  Channels host dedicated blockchain-native feeds, enabling participants to post, comment, and engage transparently while retaining complete content ownership.
- **Administrative Controls**\
  Admins have comprehensive moderation capabilities, including adding/removing moderators, managing user memberships, and ensuring community standards are maintained.
- **Transaction Fee Sponsorship**\
  Sage Protocol allows applications to subsidize or sponsor user transaction fees, significantly lowering participation friction and enabling enhanced user engagement at the application level.
- **Cross-App Composability**\
  Channels are created within specific Apps but remain openly accessible to all applications across the Sage ecosystem. Users, whose identities are global, can participate seamlessly in channels from multiple Apps. This structure enables developers to easily integrate, reference, and build upon existing channels—promoting interconnected experiences and richer engagement opportunities across the entire ecosystem.

### Future Roadmap

- **Community Governance**

  Future updates will introduce comprehensive decentralized governance mechanisms, empowering community members to collectively influence channel policies and protocol decisions.
