**Identities** in Sage are decentralized, blockchain-native objects that give users full ownership and control over their digital profiles and reputations.

Sage's identity system has two interconnected layers:

<Card title="Global Identity" icon="square-1" iconType="solid">
  Every user maintains a single, persistent, non-transferable blockchain identity entirely under their control. It includes:

  - **Core User Details:** Username, avatar, bio, and associated wallet addresses.
  - **Personalized Metadata:** Data reflecting user-defined interests and activity from various applications.
  - **Credibility Metrics:** Transparent reputation scores based directly on earned \$TRUST tokens from verified onchain social interactions.
</Card>

<Card title="App-Specific Profiles (In Development)" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
  To enhance flexibility, Sage will soon introduce customizable app-specific profiles. These profiles let users personalize their identities within individual apps. Key features include:

  - **Customizable Profiles:** Apps can define their own specific metadata fields and privacy settings aligned to unique user experiences.
  - **Selective Inheritance and Overrides:** App-specific profiles may selectively inherit information from the Global Identity or override certain attributes, enabling tailored user interactions and nuanced reputation management.
</Card>

### **Key Advantages of Sage Identity**

- **Complete User Ownership**: Users have absolute control over their private, soul-bound identities (`UserOwned`) and related reputation data. Publicly shared identities (`UserShared`) are explicitly designed for broader visibility and interaction, making them openly accessible rather than exclusively user-controlled.
- **Public Interoperability (Move Design Constraint)**: Due to constraints of the Move programming language—which requires publicly shared objects for cross-user interaction—`UserShared` identities reside explicitly onchain. This structure ensures seamless social interactions, verifiable connections, and full interoperability throughout the Sage ecosystem.
- **Portability and Composability**: Sage identities integrate seamlessly across applications, allowing users the flexibility to move between apps without losing their identities or relationships, significantly reducing platform lock-in and enhancing user autonomy.
