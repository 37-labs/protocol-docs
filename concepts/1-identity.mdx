Identity in Sage Protocol is built around decentralized, blockchain-native primitives that empower users with full control and ownership over their digital identities and reputations. Sage’s identity system has two integrated layers:

### **1. Global Soul-bound Identity**

Each user holds a single, persistent, nontransferable blockchain-based identity, fully controlled and owned by them. Key aspects include:

- **Core user details**: username, avatar, bio, and linked wallet addresses.
- **Personalized metadata**: data reflecting user interests and activities across apps.
- **Credibility metrics**: derived explicitly from accumulated \$TRUST tokens earned through verifiable social interactions and contributions onchain.

This global identity forms the backbone of user reputations, transparently reflecting genuine user activity across the entire Sage ecosystem.

### 2. **App-Specific Profiles**

To complement global identities, Sage plans to introduce customizable app-specific profiles, enabling tailored user experiences across individual applications. (Currently in development.) Key aspects include:

- **Customizable profiles**: Developers define specific metadata fields and privacy settings relevant to their application's needs.
- **Selective inheritance and overrides**: Profiles can inherit data from the global identity or selectively override it, enabling nuanced reputation management and targeted user experiences at the application level.

### **Core Advantages of Sage Identity**

- **Full user ownership**: Users retain complete control over their private, soulbound identities (UserOwned) and associated reputation data. Publicly shared identities (UserShared) are designed for broader visibility and interaction, and thus are not exclusively user-controlled.
- **Public interoperability**: Due to the Move programming language’s design—which requires objects intended for cross-user interaction to be publicly shared—UserShared identities must be accessible on-chain to facilitate social interactions, enable verifiable relationships, and ensure interoperability across the Sage ecosystem.
- **Portable and composable**: Identities seamlessly interact and integrate across the entire Sage ecosystem, ensuring user freedom and reducing platform lock-in.
