**Identities** in Sage are decentralized, blockchain-native objects that give users full ownership and control over their digital profiles and reputations.

Sage's identity system has two interconnected layers:

<Card title="Global Soul-bound Identity" icon="square-1" iconType="solid">
  Every user maintains a single, persistent, non-transferable blockchain identity entirely under their control. This global identity includes:

  - **Core User Details:** Username, avatar, bio, and linked wallet addresses.
  - **Personalized Metadata:** Information reflecting user interests and activity across multiple applications.
  - **Credibility Metrics:** Transparent reputation scores derived from earned \$TRUST tokens, i.e., earned through verified onchain social interactions.

  These components together provide a clear and authentic representation of each user's reputation across the entire Sage ecosystem.

<Card title="App-Specific Profiles (In Development)" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
  To complement global identities, Sage will introduce customizable app-specific profiles, allowing personalized user experiences within individual applications. Key features include:

  - **Customizable Profiles:** Developers define application-specific metadata fields and privacy settings tailored to their app’s unique needs.
  - **Selective Inheritance and Overrides:** App-specific profiles can selectively inherit data from the user’s global identity or override specific attributes, enabling nuanced reputation management and tailored interactions.
</Card>

### **Key Advantages of Sage Identity**

- **Complete User Ownership**: Users have absolute control over their private, soul-bound identities (`UserOwned`) and related reputation data. Publicly shared identities (`UserShared`) are explicitly designed for broader visibility and interaction, making them openly accessible rather than exclusively user-controlled.
- **Public Interoperability (Move Design Constraint)**: Due to constraints of the Move programming language—which requires publicly shared objects for cross-user interaction—`UserShared` identities reside explicitly onchain. This structure ensures seamless social interactions, verifiable connections, and full interoperability throughout the Sage ecosystem.
- **Portability and Composability**: Sage identities integrate seamlessly across applications, allowing users the flexibility to move between apps without losing their identities or relationships, significantly reducing platform lock-in and enhancing user autonomy.
