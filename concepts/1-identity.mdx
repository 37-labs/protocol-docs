Identity in Sage Protocol is built around decentralized, blockchain-native primitives that empower users with full control and ownership over their digital identities and reputations. Sage’s identity system has two integrated layers:

<Card title="Global Soul-bound Identity" icon="square-1" iconType="solid">
  Every user has a single, persistent, non-transferable identity fully controlled by them on the blockchain. This identity includes:

  - **Core User Details:** Username, avatar, bio, and linked wallet addresses.
  - **Personalized Metadata:** Data reflecting the user’s interests and activities across various applications.
  - **Credibility Metrics:** A transparent measure of user reputation derived from accumulated \$TRUST tokens, earned through verified onchain social interactions.

  These components together provide a clear and authentic representation of each user's reputation across the entire Sage ecosystem.

<Card title="App-Specific Profiles (In Development)" icon="square-2" iconType="solid">
  To complement global identities, Sage will introduce customizable app-specific profiles that enable tailored user experiences within individual applications. Key features will include:

  - **Customizable Profiles:** Developers define specific metadata fields and privacy settings suited to their application's requirements.
  - **Selective Inheritance and Overrides:** Profiles can selectively inherit data from the user's global identity or override specific elements, providing nuanced reputation management and personalized interactions at the application level.
</Card>

### **Key Advantages of Sage Identity**

- **Full User Ownership:** Users have absolute control over their private, soul-bound identities (UserOwned) and reputation data. Publicly shared identities (UserShared), however, are intended for broader visibility and interaction across the network, making them publicly accessible rather than exclusively controlled.
- **Public Interoperability (Move Design Constraint):** Due to constraints of the Move programming language—which requires objects used for cross-user interaction to be publicly accessible—UserShared identities must exist onchain to facilitate seamless social interactions, verifiable connections, and ecosystem-wide interoperability.
- **Portable and Composable:** Sage identities integrate smoothly across the entire ecosystem, giving users the freedom to move between applications without losing their identities or relationships, significantly reducing platform lock-in.
