**Posts** in Sage Protocol are blockchain-native content objects that enable creation, engagement, and monetization of user-generated content. Sage Posts serve as fundamental building blocks for decentralized social interactions and empower users to share text, images, videos, and other media types. Users retain full ownership over their content and directly benefit from community-driven engagement.

### Key Features of Posts:

- **Blockchain-Native Ownership**\
  Every post is permanently recorded onchain, ensuring transparency, verifiable authorship, and complete user ownership. Posts can seamlessly move between different apps and community channels within the Sage ecosystem.
- **Interactive Engagement**\
  Users interact with posts via blockchain-native actions (likes, comments) explicitly supported by Sage’s smart contracts and easy-to-use SDK.
- **Incentivized Participation (PoSC Rewards)**\
  Creating and interacting with content automatically triggers Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model. Users transparently earn rewards for verified social actions, with rewards instantly mintable as \$TRUST tokens, incentivizing meaningful participation.
- **Configurable Posting Conditions**\
  Specific applications or channels can define custom posting requirements, such as transaction fees (paid in \$SUI) or invite-based participation. These conditions are explicitly specified within the Sage protocol’s existing codebase.
- **Robust Moderation Tools**\
  Sage equips channel administrators and application managers with comprehensive moderation capabilities. Administrators can control content visibility, manage posts, and enforce clear community guidelines to ensure quality interactions.
- **Enhanced Discoverability and Metadata**\
  Posts include explicit metadata—such as titles, descriptions, and timestamps—to improve content discoverability and enhance user experience across all Sage-compatible applications.
- **Composable Integration Across Applications**\
  Although specific interactions (comments, likes) remain associated with the originating application, posts themselves are globally accessible throughout the Sage ecosystem. Developers can easily reference, display, and integrate existing content, fostering rich cross-application experiences and ecosystem-wide content reuse.
