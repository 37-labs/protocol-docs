**Posts** in Sage Protocol are blockchain-native content objects enabling transparent creation, interaction, and monetization. Posts serve as core social primitives, empowering users to share text, images, and other media while retaining full ownership and benefiting directly from engagement-driven incentives.

Key features of Posts in Sage include:

- **Blockchain-Native Creation and Ownership**\
  Every post is immutably recorded onchain, ensuring transparency, verifiable attribution, and full content ownership portable across all Sage applications and channels.
- **Engagement and Interaction**

  Users interact with posts through blockchain-native actions, including commenting and liking, directly supported by Sage’s smart contracts and SDK.
- **Incentivized Participation via PoSC**\
  Post creation and verified interactions automatically trigger Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model, transparently allowing users to claim rewards that are immediately minted as \$TRUST tokens. This process incentivizes authentic and meaningful participation.
- **Posting Conditions**\
  Currently, posts within channels and applications may require predefined conditions, including fee-based posting (transaction fees in \$SUI) or invite-based participation, explicitly defined in the existing codebase.
- **Administrative and Moderation Controls**\
  Channels and applications possess robust moderation capabilities, enabling admins to manage posts, moderate content visibility, and enforce clear community guidelines.
- **Discoverability and Metadata**\
  Posts include explicit metadata like titles, descriptions, and timestamps, enhancing content discoverability, transparency, and user understanding across Sage applications.
- **Composable Integration**\
  Posts are directly associated with the App in which they're created. Although modification actions (e.g., commenting, liking) are app-restricted, posts themselves are globally visible and can be viewed and integrated ("remixed") by any other App within the Sage ecosystem. This design allows developers to create unique and engaging cross-app user experiences.

### **Future Roadmap**:

- **Advanced Posting Conditions**:

  Future implementations may include additional posting restrictions based on reputation metrics (\$TRUST balances) or specific tokens/NFT holdings.
- **Programmable Content Actions**:

  Advanced customizable actions (such as paid collections, limited-edition releases, or app-specific logic) are architecturally supported, with explicit implementation planned for future releases.
