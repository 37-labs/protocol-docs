**Posts** in Sage Protocol are blockchain-native content objects that allow users to create, engage with, and monetize their content directly. Serving as essential building blocks for decentralized social interaction, Sage Posts empower users to share text, images, videos, and more—all while retaining full ownership and benefiting directly from community engagement.
