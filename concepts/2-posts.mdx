**Posts** in Sage Protocol are blockchain-native content objects that enable users to transparently create, interact with, and monetize content. Serving as core building blocks for social engagement, Sage Posts let users share text, images, videos, and other media while maintaining full ownership and directly benefiting from community interactions.

Key features of Posts in Sage include:

<Card title="Blockchain-Native Creation and Ownership">
  Every post is permanently recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, verifiable attribution, and complete ownership by users. Posts can seamlessly move between different applications and channels within the Sage ecosystem.
</Card>

<Card title="Engagement and Interaction">
  Users interact with posts through blockchain-native actions like comments and likes. These interactions are explicitly supported by Sage’s smart contracts and developer-friendly SDK.
</Card>

<Card title="Incentivized Participation via PoSC">
  Creating posts and engaging with existing content automatically activates Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model. Users transparently earn rewards for verified social actions, immediately mintable as \$TRUST tokens—encouraging authentic, meaningful interactions.
</Card>

<Card title="Posting Conditions">
  Currently, certain apps or channels may have specific posting conditions such as requiring users to pay transaction fees (in \$SUI) or participate via invites. These conditions are clearly defined in the protocol’s existing codebase.
</Card>

<Card title="Administrative and Moderation Controls">
  Sage provides strong moderation tools, enabling channel administrators and application managers to oversee content visibility, manage posts, and consistently enforce clear community guidelines.
</Card>

<Card title="Discoverability and Metadata">
  Posts include explicit metadata—such as titles, descriptions, and timestamps—to enhance content discoverability and clarity, improving user experience across all Sage applications.
</Card>

<Card title="Composable Integration">
  While post interactions (like comments and likes) are specific to the app in which the content originated, posts themselves are globally visible across the Sage ecosystem. Any Sage application can reference, display, or integrate these posts, empowering developers to create unique, cross-application user experiences.
