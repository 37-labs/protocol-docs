**Connections** in Sage Protocol represent transparent, blockchain-recorded relationships between users, capturing actions such as follows, friendships, and channel memberships. Managed entirely onchain, these relationships provide users with secure, verifiable, and economically-backed social interactions.

Key aspects of Connections in Sage include:

- **Decentralized Relationship Management**\
  Relationships between users (e.g., follows, memberships) are recorded transparently on the blockchain. These relationships are mutable—but only by the users who control them—ensuring both user autonomy and secure interactions within the protocol. This approach provides a reliable, verifiable historical record of user activities, while maintaining user control over their social connections.
- **Transparent Verification**\
  All connections within Sage are verifiable through explicit onchain records, including timestamps, connection types, and detailed relationship metadata. This comprehensive data tracking enables users and applications to analyze the history of relationships—such as how long users have been connected and the number of connection events over time. Currently, rewards are issued only upon the initial creation of a connection. This transparency ensures accountability, clear visibility, and richer insights into user interactions and their histories.
- **Economic Incentives via Transaction Fees**\
  Establishing user relationships explicitly requires paying transaction fees. These economic incentives help ensure genuine, meaningful connections and naturally deter spam and low-quality interactions.
- **Administrative Controls for Communities**\
  Channel administrators possess clear moderation capabilities, including managing membership and moderation privileges. This allows community administrators to maintain standards and ensure appropriate and positive community engagement.
- **Clear Relationship Metadata**\
  Sage records explicit metadata for each user connection, such as timestamps indicating when connections were established or modified. This detailed information enhances user understanding and context around each relationship.
- **App-Level Relationship Context with Cross-App Recommendations**

  While all user connections currently occur explicitly within the context of individual Sage Apps, the global visibility provided by blockchain-based data storage inherently enables cross-app recommendations. Sage can analyze connection patterns within specific Apps to suggest relevant connections for users across other applications, fostering richer, more interconnected experiences throughout the ecosystem.
