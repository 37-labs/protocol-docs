**Connections** in Sage Protocol represent user relationships—like follows, friendships, and channel memberships—that are securely recorded onchain. These blockchain-native connections make social interactions in the Sage ecosystem verifiable, secure, and economically meaningful.

### Key Features of Connections:

<Card title="Decentralized Relationship Management">
  - Clearly records user relationships (follows, memberships) directly onchain.
  - Users maintain complete control, privacy, and security.
  - Connections can be easily updated or managed, ensuring accurate interaction histories.
</Card>

<Card title="Transparent Verification">
  - Each connection is explicitly recorded onchain with clear details:
    - Creation and update timestamps.
    - Relationship type (e.g., follow, membership).
    - Comprehensive metadata.
  - Enables straightforward analysis of relationship history, duration, and frequency.
  - Rewards for creating connections are issued only at initial establishment, ensuring accountability.
</Card>

<Card title="Economic Incentives via Transaction Fees">
  - Creating or managing connections requires explicit transaction fees.
  - Fees incentivize genuine relationships and discourage spam or low-quality interactions.
</Card>

<Card title="Robust Administrative Controls">
  - Provides channel administrators with comprehensive moderation tools:
    - Membership management.
    - Moderation privilege settings.
    - Enforcement of clear community guidelines.
  - Ensures consistent, high-quality community interactions.
</Card>

<Card title="Detailed Relationship Metadata">
  Connections contain detailed contextual information:

  - Explicit timestamps (creation, updates).
  - Clear historical context for each relationship.
</Card>

<Card title="Cross-App Relationship Insights and Recommendations">
  - Global blockchain visibility enables analysis across multiple Sage apps.
  - Interaction patterns from one app can drive relevant connection suggestions in another.
  - Facilitates richer, interconnected experiences throughout the Sage ecosystem.
