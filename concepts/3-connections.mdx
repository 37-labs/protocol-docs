**Connections** in Sage Protocol represent user relationships—such as follows, friendships, and channel memberships—securely recorded onchain. These blockchain-native connections enable secure, verifiable, and economically-aligned social interactions within the Sage ecosystem.

### Key Features of Connections:

- **Decentralized Relationship Management**\
  Relationships such as follows or channel memberships are clearly recorded and fully controlled by the users themselves, ensuring autonomy, privacy, and security. Users can freely manage or update their connections, maintaining an accurate and verifiable history of interactions.
- **Transparent Verification**\
  Sage records each connection explicitly onchain, including details such as timestamps, relationship types, and comprehensive metadata. This transparency allows users and applications to easily analyze relationship histories, connection durations, and interaction frequencies. Rewards for creating connections are currently issued only at the time of initial connection establishment, providing clear accountability and verifiable incentives.
- **Economic Incentives via Transaction Fees**\
  Explicit transaction fees are required when creating or managing connections. These fees economically incentivize meaningful, authentic relationships, naturally discouraging spam and low-quality interactions.
- **Robust Administrative Controls**\
  Channel administrators have clear moderation capabilities, enabling effective management of memberships, moderation privileges, and community guidelines. These tools ensure consistent and high-quality community engagement.
- **Detailed Relationship Metadata**\
  Each recorded connection includes explicit metadata such as creation and update timestamps. This detailed context provides users with a clear understanding of the history and significance of each connection.
- **Cross-App Relationship Insights and Recommendations**\
  While connections originate within specific Sage applications, their global blockchain visibility enables sophisticated cross-app analysis and recommendations. By analyzing interaction patterns from one application, Sage can suggest relevant connections in another, creating more interconnected, engaging, and contextually rich user experiences across the entire ecosystem.
