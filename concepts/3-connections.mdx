**Connections** in Sage Protocol represent clear, transparent relationships between users, such as follows, friendships, and channel memberships, all securely recorded on the blockchain. These onchain relationships provide users with secure, verifiable, and economically-backed social interactions.

Key features of Connections in Sage include:

<Card title="Decentralized Relationship Management">
  Relationships—such as follows or memberships—are transparently stored onchain. These connections are fully controlled by the users themselves, ensuring autonomy and security. Users can update or manage their connections freely, maintaining an accurate, verifiable history of social interactions.
</Card>

<Card title="Transparent Verification">
  All connections in Sage are explicitly verifiable through blockchain records that include timestamps, connection types, and detailed relationship metadata. This allows both users and applications to gain deep insights into relationship histories—such as connection duration and interaction frequency. Currently, rewards are issued only upon the initial creation of a connection, providing clear accountability and transparency.
</Card>

<Card title="Economic Incentives via Transaction Fees">
  Creating or managing user connections requires explicit transaction fees. These fees act as natural incentives for genuine, meaningful connections, helping prevent spam and discourage low-quality or artificial interactions.
</Card>

<Card title="Administrative Controls for Communities">
  Channel administrators have effective moderation tools, allowing them to manage memberships, control moderation privileges, and uphold community standards. This ensures community spaces maintain appropriate, high-quality engagement.
</Card>

<Card title="Clear Relationship Metadata">
  Each connection includes explicit metadata, such as timestamps recording when relationships were formed or updated. This detailed context provides users clear insights into the history and meaning of their connections.
</Card>

<Card title="Cross-App Relationship Context and Recommendations">
  Although user connections currently exist within individual Sage applications, their onchain visibility naturally allows cross-app recommendations. Sage can analyze interaction patterns within one application to suggest relevant connections in another, creating richer and more interconnected user experiences across the entire ecosystem.
