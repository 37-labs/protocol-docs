**Rewards** in Sage Protocol are transparently calculated token incentives explicitly granted to users for authentic, blockchain-verified social activities. Sage employs its Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model to measure, validate, and fairly reward meaningful user contributions across the ecosystem.

### Key Features of Rewards:

- **Transparent Reward Calculation**\
  Rewards are calculated based on clearly defined criteria:
  - **Transaction Fees:** USD-equivalent value of the transaction fee paid at the time of the action.
  - **Market Price of \$TRUST:** The current market price of \$TRUST tokens.
  - **Action Weighting:** Numeric weights explicitly defined by Sage and implemented directly in code.

    _(Note: Currently, action weights are explicitly fixed in code; dynamic adjustments based on real-time conditions are planned for future updates.)_
- **Action Weighting Model**\
  Eligible social activities—such as creating content, liking posts, commenting, forming connections, or engaging in communities—are assigned a numeric weighting reflecting its relative value to the network. This transparent weighting clearly differentiates and incentivizes user actions based on their contribution level.
- **Incremental Engagement Rewards**\
  Ongoing engagement is incentivized beyond beyond initial content creation. Subsequent interactions—likes, shares, and comments—generate additional rewards transparently distributed to the original content creator. Participants engaging with content also receive proportional rewards, encouraging sustained and authentic community involvement.
- **Minting Rights for \$TRUST**\
  Users receive rights to mint the precise amount of \$TRUST tokens calculated by the PoSC reward logic. Users actively claim and mint these tokens themselves, ensuring direct alignment between rewards and genuine economic activity.
- **Economic Sustainability and Transparency**\
  By explicitly tying rewards to measurable economic actions (transaction fees), Sage aligns incentives closely with authentic user effort, naturally discouraging spam and promoting long-term economic sustainability. Robust anti-gaming mechanisms, such as adaptive transaction fee scaling and verifiable user actions, reinforce the reward system's transparency and integrity.
