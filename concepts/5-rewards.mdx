**Rewards** in Sage Protocol are transparently calculated token incentives, granted directly to users for authentic, blockchain-verified social activities. Using the Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model, Sage measures, validates, and fairly rewards meaningful user contributions throughout the ecosystem.

### Key Features of Rewards:

<Card title="Transparent Reward Calculation">
  Rewards are transparently calculated based on three clear criteria:

  - **Transaction Fees:** The USD-equivalent value of the transaction fee paid for the action.
  - **Market Price of \$TRUST:** The real-time market price of \$TRUST tokens.
  - **Action Weighting:** Numeric weights explicitly set by Sage and embedded directly in code.\
    _(Note: Action weights are currently fixed, with dynamic real-time adjustments planned for future releases.)_
</Card>

<Card title="Action Weighting Model">
  - Every eligible social action—creating content, liking, commenting, forming connections, or engaging in communities—has a predefined numeric weight.
  - Clearly differentiates and incentivizes user activities based on their relative contribution to the ecosystem.
</Card>

<Card title="Incremental Engagement Rewards">
  - Content creators earn additional rewards from subsequent interactions (likes, shares, comments) on their content.
  - Users who engage with content also earn proportional rewards.
  - Encourages sustained, authentic community involvement and continued engagement.
</Card>

<Card title="Minting Rights for $TRUST">
  - Users are granted the right to mint exactly the number of \$TRUST tokens calculated by the PoSC logic.
  - Tokens are actively claimed and minted by users, aligning rewards directly with genuine economic contributions.
</Card>

<Card title="Economic Sustainability and Transparency">
  - Rewards are directly linked to measurable economic actions (transaction fees), aligning incentives with genuine user effort.
  - Naturally deters spam and superficial actions, promoting long-term sustainability.
  - Built-in anti-gaming measures (adaptive transaction fee scaling, verifiable user actions) reinforce the integrity of the reward system.
