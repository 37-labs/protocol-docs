**Rewards** in Sage Protocol are explicitly calculated token incentives, transparently awarded to users for authentic, blockchain-verified social actions. Sage leverages its Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model to measure, validate, and precisely reward meaningful user contributions.

Key aspects of Sage Rewards include:

<Card title="Explicit Reward Calculation">
  Rewards are precisely determined using transparent, predefined criteria:

  - The **USD-equivalent transaction fee** paid at the time of the action
  - The current **market price of \$TRUST** tokens
  - Numeric **action weighting** (clearly defined by Sage and implemented in code)

  _Note: Currently, action weightings are explicitly fixed in code; dynamic adjustments based on real-time fees are not yet implemented._
</Card>

<Card title="Action Weighting Model">
  User activities—such as creating content, liking posts, commenting, forming connections, or community participation—are categorized by effort and network impact, each assigned a transparent numeric weight clearly reflecting their value to the ecosystem.
</Card>

<Card title="Incremental Engagement Rewards">
  Ongoing, transparent incentives beyond initial content creation. Under this model, subsequent interactions—such as likes, shares, and comments—generate additional rewards that are explicitly and transparently distributed to the original content creator. Additionally, each participant performing these interactions receives their own proportional rewards, encouraging continuous, authentic engagement across the ecosystem.
</Card>

<Card title="Minting Rights for $TRUST">
  Users gain explicit rights to mint the precise amount of \$TRUST tokens calculated by the PoSC mechanism. Users actively claim and mint these tokens themselves, ensuring rewards always align exactly with genuine economic activity and engagement.
</Card>

<Card title="Economic Sustainability and Transparency">
  Rewards tied explicitly to measurable economic actions (transaction fees) align incentives with authentic user effort, naturally discourage spam, and promote economic sustainability. Built-in anti-gaming measures, such as adaptive transaction fee scaling and fully verifiable user actions, reinforce the transparency and integrity of the reward system.
