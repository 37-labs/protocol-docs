**Rewards** in Sage Protocol are explicitly calculated token incentives, transparently and verifiably issued to users in return for authentic, blockchain-recorded social actions. Sage uses its core incentive framework—**Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC)**—to quantify, validate, and precisely reward meaningful user contributions.

Key elements include:

- **Explicit Reward Calculation**\
  Rewards are precisely computed using clear, predefined criteria: the assigned numeric action weighting (determined explicitly by Sage and implemented in code), the USD-equivalent transaction fee paid at the time of the action, and the market price of \$TRUST. Currently, these weightings are fixed explicitly in code—automatic dynamic adjustment of fees or rewards based on real-time transaction costs is not implemented.
- **Action Weighting Model**\
  User actions (such as posting content, liking, commenting, forming connections, or engaging in communities) are categorized based on effort and network impact, with transparent numeric weights based on its relative impact and value to the network. 
- **Incremental Engagment Reward Distribution**\
  Initial content actions receive explicitly calculated single rewards. Subsequent engagement actions (likes, shares, comments) yield additional incremental rewards transparently distributed to the original creator. Simultaneously, engaging participants receive individual rewards proportional to their validated actions.
- **Minting Rights for \$TRUST**\
  Rewards grant users explicit rights to mint the exact amount of \$TRUST tokens calculated by the PoSC evaluation. Users explicitly claim and mint these tokens, ensuring minting directly corresponds to authentic engagement and economic activity.
- **Economic Sustainability and Transparency**\
  Rewards explicitly anchored to measurable economic activity and transaction fees maintain incentive alignment, discourage spam, and ensure economic sustainability. Built-in anti-gaming measures—such as adaptive transaction fee scaling and verifiable actions—reinforce transparency and integrity.

By explicitly structuring rewards around verified, economically-backed actions, Sage ensures transparent incentives and fair, sustainable ecosystem growth.
