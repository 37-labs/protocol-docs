An **App** in Sage Protocol is an onchain entity with its own distinct identity, settings, and reward structures. Apps built on Sage utilize decentralized identity, transparent incentives, and composable social primitives to deliver engaging and economically aligned user experiences.

Developers and creators can easily set up and customize their Sage Apps with these capabilities:

<Card title="App Identity and Metadata">
  Each app has a unique onchain identity with customizable metadata—such as names, descriptions, and associated visuals—clearly defining its purpose and identity to users.
</Card>

<Card title="Reward Customization">
  Currently, reward structures within Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model are globally standardized. All user actions—like posting, liking, or commenting—share common incentive weights across the Sage ecosystem. Individual apps cannot currently define unique rewards for the same action. In future updates, global reward parameters and action weightings will be collectively governed and adjusted through Sage's decentralized governance, ensuring reward alignment evolves transparently in line with community priorities.
</Card>

<Card title="Social Graph Integration">
  Sage Apps integrate smoothly with the decentralized, Sybil-resistant social graph, leveraging user identities (`UserOwned`), connections, and community structures to create targeted and personalized user experiences.
</Card>

<Card title="Content Management">
  Blockchain-native content is transparently managed, empowering apps to handle content creation, curation, and monetization directly through Sage’s primitives. This ensures complete transparency and content ownership by users.
</Card>

<Card title="Governance and Administration">
  Robust administrative tools allow apps to easily manage administrators, dynamically adjust settings and reward structures, and proactively respond to evolving community dynamics and user needs.
</Card>

<Card title="Transaction Fee Sponsorship (Future Capability)">
  Sage explicitly plans for future apps to sponsor or subsidize user transaction fees, significantly reducing participation friction and enhancing user adoption and retention.
</Card>

<Card title="Community Integration">
  Apps directly integrate with Sage’s modular community structures—like channels—to facilitate community-driven interactions, verifiable memberships, and transparent, incentivized engagement.
