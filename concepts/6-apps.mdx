An **App** in Sage Protocol is an onchain entity with its own unique identity, settings, and reward configurations. Apps built on Sage leverage decentralized identity, transparent incentives, and composable social primitives to create engaging and economically aligned user experiences.

Developers and creators can easily establish and customize Apps with the following capabilities:

- **App Identity and Metadata**\
  Each App maintains a distinct onchain identity, including customizable metadata such as names, descriptions, and associated images—clearly communicating app identity and purpose.
- **Reward Customization**\
  Currently, reward structures are globally defined within Sage’s Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model. All eligible user actions (such as posting, liking, or commenting) share a common set of incentive weights across the entire Sage ecosystem. Individual apps cannot currently customize separate reward calculations for the same action. In the future, global reward parameters and incentive weightings will be governed and adjusted collectively by the community through Sage's governance framework (once fully implemented). This ensures reward alignment evolves transparently according to broader community objectives.
- **Social Graph Integration**\
  Apps integrate seamlessly with Sage’s decentralized, Sybil-resistant social graph, leveraging user identities (UserOwned), connections, and community structures for targeted audience engagement and personalized experiences.
- **Content Management**\
  Blockchain-native content is transparently managed, enabling Apps to handle content creation, curation, and monetization directly through the protocol's primitives, providing complete transparency and user ownership.
- **Governance and Administration**\
  Robust administrative capabilities allow Apps to manage administrators, dynamically adjust app settings, reward structures, and respond proactively to evolving user needs and community dynamics.
- **Transaction Fee Sponsorship (Future Capability)**\
  Sage Protocol explicitly outlines transaction fee sponsorship at the application level, empowering future Apps to subsidize or sponsor user transaction fees. This capability significantly lowers participation friction, enhancing user adoption and retention.
- **Community Integration**\
  Apps directly connect with Sage’s modular community structures—such as channels—allowing integration of community-driven interactions, verifiable memberships, and transparent, incentivized engagement.

### **Future Roadmap**:

- **Community Governance**

  Comprehensive decentralized governance features—such as onchain voting and proposal systems—will be progressively introduced, enabling app-specific community decisions and collective protocol evolution.
