**Apps** in Sage Protocol are decentralized, onchain entities with unique identities and customizable configurations. They leverage decentralized identities, transparent incentives, and modular social primitives, allowing developers to build engaging user experiences aligned with economic incentives and community values.

### Key Features of Sage Apps

<Card title="Unique App Identity and Customization">
  - Each App has its own distinct onchain identity.
  - Clearly defined through customizable metadata:
    - Name and description
    - Branding elements (imagery, banners, avatars)
  - Clearly communicates purpose and branding to users.
</Card>

<Card title="Reward Customization (Upcoming Governance)">
  - Currently, Sage's Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) rewards are standardized across the ecosystem (posting, liking, commenting share common weights).
  - Future decentralized governance mechanisms will allow community-driven customization:
    - Enable Apps to tailor rewards to user needs.
    - Transparently adjust reward parameters based on community feedback.
</Card>

<Card title="Social Graph Integration">
  - Apps seamlessly integrate Sageâ€™s decentralized, Sybil-resistant social graph.
  - Leverage user-owned identities, transparent connections, and community structures.
  - Deliver personalized and contextually rich user experiences.
</Card>

  Blockchain-native content management tools empower Apps to:

  - Transparently create, curate, and monetize content.
  - Maintain full user ownership and verifiable content attribution.
</Card>

<Card title="Governance and Administrative Controls">
  Robust administrative capabilities for App developers and admins:

  - Role management and permissions.
