An **App** in Sage Protocol is a decentralized onchain entity with its own distinct identity and  configurations. Sage Apps leverage decentralized identities, transparent reward structures, and composable social primitives, enabling developers to create engaging user experiences that are economically aligned and community-driven.

### Key Features of Sage Apps

- **App Identity and Customizable Metadata**\
  Each App possesses a unique onchain identity, explicitly defined through customizable metadata such as names, descriptions, and associated imagery. This clearly communicates each App’s purpose and branding to users.
- **Reward Customization**\
  Currently, rewards within Sage's Proof of Social Contribution (PoSC) model are standardized across the entire ecosystem—actions like posting, liking, and commenting share common reward weights. While individual Apps cannot yet customize distinct rewards for identical actions, future updates will introduce decentralized governance mechanisms. These will enable community-driven adjustments to reward parameters, transparently aligning incentives with evolving user needs and community objectives.
- **Social Graph Integration**\
  Sage Apps seamlessly integrate with the decentralized, Sybil-resistant social graph, utilizing user-owned identities, transparent connections, and community structures to deliver personalized and targeted user experiences.
- **Content Management**\
  Blockchain-native content management within Sage empowers Apps to transparently create, curate, and monetize content directly through Sage’s social primitives. Users retain full content ownership and transparency throughout.
- **Governance and Administrative Control**\
  Apps include robust administrative capabilities, allowing developers and administrators to manage roles, dynamically adjust app-specific settings, update reward configurations, and proactively respond to community feedback and user engagement patterns.
- **Transaction Fee Sponsorship (Upcoming Capability)**\
  Sage Protocol explicitly anticipates future enhancements allowing Apps to sponsor or subsidize user transaction fees. This will reduce participation barriers, significantly increasing user adoption, engagement, and retention.
- **Community Integration**\
  Sage Apps directly integrate with the protocol’s modular community components—such as Channels—to facilitate transparent, verifiable memberships, community-driven interactions, and incentivized participation across the ecosystem.
