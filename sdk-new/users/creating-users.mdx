Users are central to Sage Protocol’s decentralized social ecosystem. Every user maintains a global identity across all Sage-enabled apps while interacting uniquely within each application.

## Creating Users

Creating a user establishes a global identity within Sage. Currently, user creation requires invite codes and keys:

```javascript
const result = await sageClient.createUser({
  inviteCode: 'your-invite-code',
  inviteKey: 'your-invite-key',
  name: 'john-doe',
  description: 'Blockchain enthusiast',
  self: walletAddress
});

if (result.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: result.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(result.err);
}
```

## User Identities Explained

Sage generates two distinct user objects:

- **Owned User Object**: Soulbound to your wallet. Authenticates your wallet as a valid protocol user, enabling you to create content, follow users, and perform other wallet-signed actions.
- **Shared User Object**: Publicly referenced by others for social interactions (e.g., friending, following, or engaging with your content).

(Users typically don’t need to distinguish these objects explicitly; this detail is primarily relevant for developers.)

## User Management Best Practices

- Clearly guide users through wallet connections and transaction signing.
- Validate all user inputs, sanitizing markdown content to prevent XSS.
- Display clear feedback on successful or failed interactions.
- Offer intuitive interfaces for social relationship management (follow/friend actions).
