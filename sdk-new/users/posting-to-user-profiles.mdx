Users can directly post content onto other users' profiles. This feature is ideal for professional endorsements, community appreciation, or direct interactions:

```javascript
const postResult = await sageClient.postToUser({
  sharedUserId: 'target-user-shared-id',
  title: 'ðŸŒŸ Professional Recommendation',
  description: 'Endorsement for exceptional work',
  data: 'Your contributions to the project were outstanding!',
  ownedUserId: 'your-owned-user-id',
  self: walletAddress
});

if (postResult.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: postResult.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(postResult.err);
}
```
