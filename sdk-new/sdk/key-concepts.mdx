Before diving into advanced SDK usage, it’s important to understand a few key concepts and patterns central to Sage Protocol and its SDK. This section covers essential architectural and usage details to ensure a smooth integration process.

### Application Isolation and Context (`appId`)

Sage Protocol isolates content and interactions per application by using a unique identifier (`appId`). Each application maintains distinct channels and posts, while user identities and social graphs remain global across all Sage-compatible apps.

**What this means for you:**

- Users have one global identity and consistent social relationships everywhere.
- Each app provides distinct, tailored content experiences to its community.

### Invite-Based User Creation (Temporary)

Currently, Sage Protocol requires invite codes and keys for new user creation. Invite-based onboarding helps applications manage and control initial growth and user engagement quality.

- **Invite Code**: A unique code to authorize user creation.
- **Invite Key**: A secure key provided alongside the invite code.

_(Note: Future protocol versions will make invite codes optional.)_

### Transaction Patterns

All Sage SDK operations that write data to the blockchain follow a consistent transaction workflow, clearly divided into two steps:

1. **Construct Transaction**:\
   SDK methods generate and return transaction objects ready for signing.
2. **Sign and Execute Transaction**:\
   Your application manages wallet interactions to securely sign and execute transactions.

**Example workflow:**

```javascript
const result = await sageClient.createUser({
  amounts: [0, 0],
  name: "john-doe",
  description: "Web3 enthusiast",
  inviteCode: "your-invite-code",
  inviteKey: "your-invite-key",
  self: walletAddress
});

if (result.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: result.transaction });
} else {
  console.error(result.err);
}
```

This separation ensures security and user transparency for all blockchain interactions.

### Error Handling

The Sage SDK consistently returns results indicating success or error states. All responses use a structured pattern with two important properties:

- `ok`: Indicates success (`true`) or failure (`false`).
- `err`: Provides detailed error information when the transaction fails.

**Recommended handling pattern:**

```javascript
const result = await sageClient.someAction({ /* parameters */ });

if (result.ok) {
  // Handle successful transaction
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: result.transaction });
} else {
  // Handle errors explicitly
  console.error('Error:', result.err);
}
```

Always verify transactions by checking the `ok` property before proceeding.

### Event Monitoring and Querying

Sage SDK provides powerful event monitoring capabilities. Events (such as user creation, posting, and channel updates) are emitted explicitly onchain, enabling:

- Real-time responsiveness in your app.
- Precise analytics and user activity tracking.

You can query and listen for these events directly through the SDK.

### React Context and Hooks

For React applications, Sage SDK provides built-in context and custom React hooks (`useUser`, `useChannel`, `usePost`). This allows streamlined integration and simple state management, significantly improving developer experience in React-based apps.

**Example (React integration):**

```javascript
import { useChannel } from '@sageprotocol/sdk/react';

function ChannelComponent({ channelId }) {
  const { follow, unfollow } = useChannel();

  const handleFollow = async () => {
    const result = await follow({
      channelId,
      amounts: [0, 0],
      ownedUserId: userContext.ownedUserId,
      self: userContext.walletAddress
    });

    if (result.ok) {
      await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: result.transaction });
    } else {
      console.error(result.err);
    }
  };

  return <button onClick={handleFollow}>Follow Channel</button>;
}
```

Using hooks simplifies interactions with Sage primitives and maintains clean, readable code.
