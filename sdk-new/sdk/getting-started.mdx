This guide will help you quickly set up and integrate the Sage SDK into your application. Follow these straightforward steps to begin building decentralized social experiences with Sage.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing the Sage SDK, ensure your environment meets these requirements:

- **Node.js and npm:**

  Install Node.js (**v18 or higher**) and npm ([nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)).
- **Sui Wallet:**

  Obtain a Sui blockchain wallet (e.g., Suiet, Phantom, Slush). This wallet is required to sign and execute transactions.
- **Invite Codes (temporary requirement):**

  Currently, user creation requires valid invite codes and invite keys provided by Sage.
- **Network Access:**

  Choose your network environment:
  - **mainnet:** production environment
  - **testnet:** development and testing environment

## 2. Installation

Install the Sage SDK via your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm i @sageprotocol/sdk
```


```bash yarn
yarn add @sageprotocol/sdk
```


```bash npm
npm i @sageprotocol/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Choose Your Integration Method

The Sage SDK supports two integration methods:

- \*\*Direct JavaScript Integration: \*\*Directly use the `SageClient` class for explicit SDK management.
- \*\*React Integration: \*\*Use built-in React hooks and the `SageProvider` for state-managed React apps.

This guide covers the Direct JavaScript Integration method. If using React, see the React Integration guide.

## 4. Basic Setup (Direct Javascript Integration)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import the SDK">
    ```javascript
    import { SageClient } from '@sageprotocol/sdk';
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize the Client">
    Create an instance of the `SageClient` and initialize it:

    ```javascript
    const sage = new SageClient({
      network: 'testnet' // or 'mainnet'
    });
    
    await sage.initialize();
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Sui Wallet Integration">
    Your application must handle wallet connections for transaction signing. Ensure users connect their Sui wallet and your app can request signatures.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Creating Your First User

Create a new Sage user (temporarily requires invite code):

```javascript
const result = await sage.createUser({
  inviteCode: 'your-invite-code',
  inviteKey: 'your-invite-key',
  name: 'john-doe',
  description: 'Web3 enthusiast',
  self: walletAddress
});

if (result.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: result.transaction });
} else {
  console.error('Error creating user:', result.err);
}
```

## 6. Verify Successful Setup

Once you've executed the transaction successfully, your user identity is created. You can confirm the creation by querying your Sage profile or performing another simple operation, such as creating a basic post:

```javascript
const postResult = await sage.postToUser({
  amounts: [0, 0],
  sharedUserId: 'target-user-shared-id',
  title: 'Hello Sage!',
  description: 'My first decentralized post',
  data: 'Excited to join the Sage community!',
  ownedUserId: 'your-owned-user-id',
  self: walletAddress
});

if (postResult.ok) {
  await signAndExecuteTransaction({ transaction: postResult.transaction });
} else {
  console.error('Error creating post:', postResult.err);
}
```
